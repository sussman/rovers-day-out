Rover&apos;s Day Out
An Interactive Simulation by Janet Xiang
Release beta 732 / Serial number 23920401 / Inform 10.6 build Mu-013 (I6/v.7.1 lib 7/18N)

Rover draws pensively on his stubby cigar, the tip glowing red below his dealer&apos;s hat. He paws nonchalantly at the scotch and water he has been nursing for the last half hour. Despite the tower of chips in front of him, he&apos;s either in trouble now, or trying to play the rest of the table for suckers. His tail is no longer wagging, though, and you suspect that the scotch may be getting the better of him. He can&apos;t mass more than about 30 kilos, and he&apos;s been putting them away tonight. You push all in, figuring that even if you lose it all, at least you&apos;ll get some sleep before you need to get back to the MARSpace. Elva the cleaning lady folds, as does Isaac Asimov and that boy that you kissed in fourth grade. Wait...don&apos;t go....where is everyone going?



David: You have some weird dreams.
Janet: You can&apos;t hold me responsible for the subconscious
       ramblings of the ACU.

Living Room
You are in the living room of a small cottage. Piped-in sunlight pours in through the room&apos;s single window, illuminating a framed picture on the opposite wall.

The cottage&apos;s front door is closed.

On the purple futon is an alarm clock.

Rover&apos;s Day Out
An Interactive Simulation by Janet Xiang
Release beta810 / Serial number 23920415 / Inform 10.6 build Mu-013 (I6/v.7.1 lib 7/18N)

Rover sniffs the air and tears away from the picnic blanket. You and Tomasz watch with surprise as he runs, for once, away from the food. Rover bounds over the hedges, howling wildly, and spooks a xihuahua that had been playing with a tiny red ball. The so-called &quot;shaved rat&quot; gulps an oversized portion of air, extends its membranous ears, and flies across the park into the arms of a stooped grey-haired woman with a cane. Rover picks up the ball triumphantly, ignoring the piercing wavetrain of yips and indignant scolding coming, respectively, from the xihuahua and its owner. Shaking her cane limply towards Rover, she admonishes in a strong Earth accent &quot;That mongrel should be on a leash!&quot; Her own, unleashed, uncollared neodog stares accusingly from the safety of her arms, its distensible ribs alternately inflating and deflating like bellows. &quot;Your kind is ruining Mars, ignoring every law, dissing your elders! You never lived on the surface, you never don&apos;t know what you&apos;ve got!&quot;. You try to give the ball back to her, but she pushes it away in disgust, &quot;Kids. Meh.&quot;



David: Hey, different dream sequence. Is it glitching?
Janet: No, the ACU&apos;s dreams are heavily influenced by power-up
       state of the processor and internal noise. Every time
       the ship dehibernates after a Casimir jump, it will
       experience some sort of dreaming. Some of them can
       be pretty bizarre.
David: Good, I&apos;d hate to think that we wasted two weeks of
       programming.
Janet: I wouldn&apos;t say wasted.
David: Huh? I didn&apos;t mean us.
Janet: Cross your fingers and hope the whole thing doesn&apos;t
       crash again on the heat lamp.

Janet: If there were some heavy helium left after landing,
       could the ship take off again?
David: Hypothetically, yes, but the planet has essentially
       no atmosphere to break against and it has about nine
       times Earth gravity. Even with optimal approach we&apos;ll
       have to fuse every gram of that heavy helium to make
       a soft landing.
Janet: I just hate to leave the ship there. It could take
       years before our next Casimir ship will be built,
       and who knows if Valkyrie will survive that long on

Janet: When Rover brings the probe back to the ship, it will

       and coordinates are encrypted. It&apos;s too bad they didn&apos;t
       have FTL communications when they built the probes
       -- it would have saved us the trip.

Rover&apos;s Day Out
An Interactive Simulation by Janet Xiang and David Venkatachalam
Release 1 / Serial number 23920416 / Inform 10.6 build Mu-013 (I6/v.7.1 lib 7/18N)

Even mildly drugged and reclining on an overstuffed couch in the MARSpace human resources office, it&apos;s hard to relax in the presence of the MARSpace political officer conducting the final interview. You didn&apos;t catch her name, probably because she never mentioned it. After three such interviews and six months of background check, what more could they want?  

&quot;Ms. Xiang, thank you for your cooperation. Your tests show no hint of disloyalty to the Republic or MARSpace. We hope you understand the need for these measures, particularly for personnel with access to the Valkyrie&apos;s command and control functions. Now that you are cleared, I can inform you that credible sources have warned that the project may have been infiltrated by...&quot;

&lt;BEEP&gt; &lt;BEEP&gt; &lt;BEEP&gt;

You weren&apos;t particularly enjoying this dream, but being jarred awake by a violently shaking futon is even less pleasurable.

As the bed bucks and tumbles, several scenarios flash through your mind: explosive decompression of the dome? Volcanic activity? Meteor impact? Before you can even consider your next action, you are thrown from the futon onto the living room floor. Light pours in from the window. It looks like the drapes were somehow torn away from the window.

Your cottage&apos;s living room is palatial compared to your bathroom. There is a pink marble counter and above it you&apos;ve mounted a mirror on the wall. To the right of the mirror is a black glass plate. Between the counter and the shower is a white, porcelain toilet.

On the marble counter are a plastic box and a toothbrush.

You can also see a flight suit here.

From the direction of the kitchen, you hear Rover running in circles.

Rover taps conspiratorily on his food bowl.

Rover wags his tail and gnaws on his bone.

You rub his head, distantly, as strange thoughts sweep through your consciousness. You wonder what would happen if the Valkyrie mission failed. What if, during the landing sequence, the ship were buffeted by the planet&apos;s particulate matter being torn away by the immense gravity of its star? In that case, critical systems might be damaged. Systems like the relatively fragile ansible antenna. There is no backup ansible antenna. How would the ACU cope with a situation like that? The ACU was designed for a lot of contingencies, but not that one. What would you do? What would you do if you were the ACU?

Your glance falls on your flight suit, and suddenly the question is no longer rhetorical.

(The player is now self-aware)
Living Room
The Valkyrie&apos;s cargo bay is like a great, metal cave. The Casimir Drive juts slightly into the cargo area. From this section of the ship, there are connections to the engineering and flight control decks. The cargo bay doors are closed.

ROVER chews contentedly on his bone.

You can also see a heavy helium sphere and a temporal transgressor here.

Nanobristles swarm from their hatcheries and up the tubules towards the deck surface. They spread across the deck, abrading and oxidizing the surface, scrubbing it clean of any contaminant and redistributing the permalloy skin of the ship to smooth microscopic dents from micrometeorite impacts.

When the microscopic cleaners encounter the docking port and struts from the assault ship, they immediately recognize it as a contaminant and chirp microwave signals to the host of nanobristles behind them. The message propagates back to the hatcheries, where production is increased exponentially. Meanwhile, the vanguard has already swarmed up the docking port and across the surface of the assault ship. A lucky few nanobristles blaze the path into the assault ship through exhaust ports, thruster nozzles, and waste management ductwork, where they continue to clean and organize, according to their programming.

A brilliant flash of light and a burst of hard radiation is followed an instant later by a hail of smaller particles and a few large crashes that shake the Valkyrie. This debris is all that remains of the assault ship.

In the distance, patrolling gunships move into supporting positions, while a second assault ship begins its approach, aiming for approximately the same point on the hull as the Graceful Wind.

The second assault ship breaks the silence, &quot;Winter Shadow to Valkyrie, this is Captain Musante, speaking. Your unwarranted attack on our sister ship Graceful Wind has been recorded, and you will answer for it when we arrive at Luna.&quot;

The gunships sweep the Valkyrie from all angles with their phased tachyon beams, sterilizing the hull. The gunships then narrow their waveguides to focus the beams on the nanobristle mother hatchery, which vaporizes.

The ship&apos;s hull rings as the assault ship impacts the hull.

The crunch of permalloy is strident enough to peel the very skin off your teeth -- or so you suppose, making certain inaccurate assumptions about skin and teeth. The assault ship&apos;s boarding port splinters and accordions against the neoadamite ablative coating, which you applied to the Valkyrie&apos;s hull just moments ago. The midnight black assault ship spins wildly, its attitude thrusters firing in staccato bursts as it recovers and drifts away from the Valkyrie.

&quot;I should have anticipated that maneuver given the aerodynamic cut of your ship. Still, I could hardly believe it, given its size. Yes, this round goes to you, Captain, although I had hoped that we might do this more like gentlepersons.&quot;

As the assault ship stabilizes, it fires string after string of plasma flares into the Valkyrie&apos;s dorsal hull. Each flare boils the ablative coating off the surrounding hull, burning down to bare metal. Seconds later, the assault ship&apos;s X-ray laser rakes Valkyrie&apos;s master enamel irradiator node, which shatters explosively, sending spinning debris in all directions.

&quot;I need hardly tell you, Captain, that without the irradiator, your ablative coating will no longer be an issue. It&apos;s a pity that I had to destroy it -- it looked military grade. At least I can still extract the injector and accelerant pump from your extruder. Now then, no more tricks.&quot;

The assault ship resumes its course towards Valkyrie, this time presenting a different boarding port.

You sense that the intruder is relatively motionless in the extruder chamber. The extruder is a complex and delicate system, and you can easily imagine that the intruder may not understand it.

In this moment of respite, you wonder what the real Janet is doing back on Mars. You imagine that she continued her relationship with David, and that the two of them are parked on her big purple futon, chatting away, maybe even wondering whatever became of the Starship Valkyrie.

Some movement in the extruder chamber wrenches you back to the desperate situation at hand.

You feel a burning pain as the extruder chamber shakes with high-pitched vibrations. Someone is tampering with the enamel extrusion system.

You consider their tactics: they have disabled most of your flight control systems, and now they are bringing down your shielding systems. You can no longer run, and your ability to withstand attack has been compromised. All of your engineering systems are still operational (well yes, except the engine itself, of course). Most importantly, the probe data are still safe in your deep memory. For now.

Oh. That was a strange feeling. Something deep down and visceral just gave out, snapping like an elastic. It wasn&apos;t painful exactly, just odd. Diagnostics reveal complete failure of your extruder system. It&apos;s not gone, but it&apos;s such a mess that you don&apos;t think it could be fixed, even in dry dock. Your estimate of the intruder&apos;s technical skills is falling.

You take a moment to scan local space again. No telltale fusion flares, no tightly beamed messages from Mars. Only frequency-hopping encrypted local transmissions between the intruder and the assault ship. You are on your own.

Having done enough damage in the extruder chamber, the intruder seems to have started its ascent towards the engineering deck

Your thoughts race, as you try to come up with a plan to dislodge the assault ship from your hull or take some kind of vengeance on the intruder that is slowly gutting you from within.

Your thoughts drift back to Mars for a moment, and you think about how disappointed Janet will be, heck, all of Mars would be, if the probe data are captured by Earth. You resolve to put up the best fight you can, for as long as you last.

&quot;Roger, maintenance droid. Telemetry is still five-by-five. Winter Shadow standing by.&quot;

It occurs to you that if the Earth ships detected your Casimir disruption, it is just as likely that Mars did as well. Certainly, MARSpace has the equipment to sense a Casimir emergence out to the heliopause, and the Casimir disruption would propagate almost instantaneously. You perk up, buoyed by the thought that Mars may already be taking action on your behalf. Of course, that action would have to move pretty damn fast to get here before you are nothing more than a pile of scrap metal.

ROVER is definitely down for the count, but you assume there is no permanent damage. The same can&apos;t be said of the maintenance droid, which you dispose of. ROVER may be unconscious, but the space probe remains clamped in his jaws.

The flexible tubing that connects the assault ship&apos;s boarding port to the hole in Valkyrie&apos;s deck undulates, suggesting that someone else is coming board. Shortly thereafter, your sensors determine that something is moving towards the kitchen.

You find it difficult to swallow as your throat seizes up, choking you. You struggle to breathe and are overwhelmed by the hindbrain reflexes running at high priority in the overlay. Slowly, you fight for control and push the simulation to background while assessing the damage. The magnetic containment system in the fusion reactor is no longer responding to diagnostics. It too has gone offline.

You consider yourself lucky that they are going after the fusion engines rather than more critical systems. Without flight control and the extruder, it&apos;s not like you&apos;d be in any position to attempt a planetary landing even if you did have the fusion fuel to burn. You consider the possibility that they don&apos;t know the nature of your payload and really are just interested in salvage.

Shiny lights dance around in your video input, and you feel nauseous. This is exactly the kind of migraine you get after a long tube ride on Mars. The noise from the engineering section isn&apos;t helping, either. You try to concentrate. Engineering systems. Diagnostics. The cryochamber has been disabled.

You scan local space and are relieved that no more ships have arrived. Still, between the gunships and the assault craft, it would take a sizable Martian fleet to even the odds. Moving full flank on condensate drive, maybe they could reach you in a few hours. By that time, though, it&apos;s almost a certainty that reinforcements would arrive from Earth.

&quot;Right. Okay, thanks. I&apos;m going in.&quot; The maintenance droid runs into the fusion chamber and pulls the control unit out of the wall; the scene fades from your view. The maintenance droid re-emerges near the base of where the stove used to stand.

You think about your main mission objective, of getting the probe data back to Mars. You wonder recursively what Janet would do in your shoes. No doubt she&apos;d fight as long as she could and then find a way to make the best of the situation. In this case, maybe preventing Earth from getting the data would be the next best thing to fulfilling your mission directive.

You know that certain interdictions are deeply embedded in your programming: you can&apos;t harm a human (directly, anyhow, although you are willing to take some license with that particular interdiction), you can&apos;t self-destruct, and you can&apos;t erase the probe data from your deep memory.

I&apos;m sure you also have some questions about the mission that you&apos;d like answered. You can use TELL and ASK verbs, for instance &apos;TELL ABOUT THE JADE FROG&apos;, or &apos;ASK ABOUT THE JADE FROG&apos;, although when you do it, you don&apos;t have to yell. I was just doing that for emphasis.

You hear a faint hum from the cryochamber in the engineering section.

Janet peers across the room at Rover and surveys the perforated, crushed husk of the space probe in his mouth. She says, &quot;I suppose the first thing that we have to ask about is the space probe. After all, that was why we put this entire project together.&quot;

David sarcastically interjects, &quot;Yes, and what a success it was. Look -- there&apos;s the probe. Or what&apos;s left of it after your cyberhound chewed it to death. I can&apos;t tell you how many gah-zillion Marx we spent on this project, and for what?&quot;

Janet rests her hand on the sleeve of David&apos;s robe and continues calmly, &quot;Let&apos;s hear the whole story, David. ACU, please tell us what happened with the Musashi-5 space probe.&quot;

    <command xml:space="preserve">tell about probe</command>
    <result xml:space="preserve">You tell them that the probe had crashed forty years ago, on its way back to Earth. Like its sister probes that were launched from Earth almost three centuries ago by the Myomita corporation, it had explored space in an ever-expanding search pattern, refueling its condensate drive from the stellar wind of each star system it visited.

Apparently, it found a world that satisfied its search parameters, because it was on its way back to Earth when it crashed. The stellar wind of a chaotic dying star required a close approach, and the probe was damaged by a stellar flare. Instead of tumbling into the star and burning, the probe ditched on a large, rocky planet, perhaps the core of a former gas giant. The planet itself was untenably close to the star and was slowly being ripped to shreds by tidal forces, but the probe followed its programming and activated its transponder.

Listening intently, David now remarks, &quot;Whatever that probe found, it was out way beyond any of the other Musashi probes. Likely, it&apos;s gone deeper into space than any probe Earth has ever sent.&quot;

David quickly checks that his cell phone does not have reception within the MARSpace complex.
Rover slowly opens one eye, and then the other, and one paw abandons the bone momentarily to scratch his ear. He allows the bone to loll to one side of his mouth, and crunches it a bit more between his molars. He awakens leisurely, and sits up, glancing curiously at you, and then at Janet.

When the ansible failed, your programming threw a cognitive constraint exception, and you tried your best to carry out your programming by literally bringing the probe back to Mars.

David  looks forlorn. He says dejectedly, &quot;All that effort, and what do we have to show for it? Nothing. A rusty old heap of space junk. All the data, lost, and gone forever.&quot; He kicks ROVER, then quickly withdraws his bruised foot in pain, looking up at the macerated space probe.


&quot;Actually, that&apos;s not the case&quot;, you say. &quot;Before attempting to transmit the data, I downloaded the entire probe&apos;s data into my memory. The data are encrypted, but intact. When the ansible failed, the only way I could fulfill the mission was to return to the Sol System.&quot;

David&apos;s head snaps up, as if he&apos;s been given a new lease on life. David points to the hopelessly junked spaceprobe above his head. &quot;Intact? Then you have the data? This is too good to be true! Janet, would you extract the probe data from the ACU and transfer it to my MARSpace account?&quot;

&quot;Of course, just a moment. &quot;Janet&apos;s fingers play over the surface of her armband. &quot;The data are encrypted... with your key. And there&apos;s something odd...&quot; Janet&apos;s forehead creases with concentration.


&quot;No,&quot; replies David, &quot;that was intentional. To prevent it from falling into the wrong hands.&quot;

&quot;No, not the encryption, David. The ansible coordinates -- the message was directed towards Earth. Isn&apos;t that odd?&quot; Janet looks up at David, perplexed.

David expires immediately, trapped under 45 tons of angry robotic dalmatian.

&quot;Good boy!&quot; exclaims Janet, a tear in her eye. And then, turning to the ACU she admits, &quot;I wish I had thought of that.&quot;

EPILOGUE

The onboard flight recorder corroborated Janet&apos;s account of David Venkatachalam as a traitor. As the first successful roundtrip by any Casimir craft, the mission was hailed as a success throughout the Solar System, although the true nature of the mission was suppressed. Both the Autonomous Control Unit and Rover became celebrities, and after significant upgrades to their parser and conversation systems, went on the lecture circuit. The Autonomous Control Unit went on to run the life support systems throughout Cydonia, and Rover was elected to the Lower Chamber of the Martian Senate.

Subsequently, Janet Xiang was commissioned Director of MARSpace. For two years, she oversaw the refitting of the Valkyrie, including modifications to overcome the earlier limitations of Casimir Drive. When the data from the Musashi-5 space probe were finally decrypted, she was selected to command the mission to explore the evidence of life discovered by the probe. She departed from Mars on the Valkyrie in 2394 with one other crewmember: her dog, Rover.

Preview of &quot;Red Rover, Red Rover&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Rover&apos;s Day Out&quot;

Captain&apos;s Log, September 5, 2396, Janet Xiang recording. Despite our sensor anomalies and the disorienting effect of the serial Casimir jumps which brought us here, Valkyrie emerged into a textbook-perfect polar orbit about Aurora.

We&apos;re on our first pass, with an orbital period of 90 minutes, and so far we&apos;ve dropped ten probes, eight in the drink and two on land masses. The atmosphere is definitely breathable, and the probes show multicellular plant life: everything from kelp to trees. So far, no animal life, not even zooplankton. Rover is eager to be the first. Two years on a space ship are too long to go between walks.

We&apos;ll be in communications blackout for the next 20 hours, so I&apos;m sending this initial report ahead of schedule. There&apos;s one other item I need to mention: shortly after we arrived, we detected what looked like a secondary tachyon emission near the south pole. It was a momentary pulse, and we can&apos;t tell if it came from the pole itself, or just originated in that direction relative to Valkyrie. We&apos;ll drop surface and air probes more densely over the south polar area, and we&apos;ll scan that cone with our ansible while awaiting the next window with the MARSpace relay.

Oh, and to make this official: This is Captian Janet Xiang of the MARSpace Exploration Vessel Valkyrie. I hereby claim planet Aurora as territory of the People&apos;s Republic of Mars.

Of the 187 things you did today, you must have gotten some of them right, because you didn&apos;t screw up the entire universe and you&apos;re still alive to read about it. Before you get too cocky, however, here are a few hints about stuff you might want to look for the next time you play &quot;Rover&apos;s Day Out&quot;:

* As the ACU, you experienced four of the seven possible dream sequences . Getting up in the morning and getting things done is all well and fine, but a you can afford to dream a little.

* During personality imprinting, both the ACU and Rover incorporated memories from their real-life counterparts. You tapped into zero out of the twenty-nine engrams resident in the ACU memory banks, and zero out of Rover&apos;s thirty-four memories.

* When the Myomita merchant marine ships intercepted you on the way back to Mars, you managed to employ four out of the eight or so methods to eliminate them from the ship. You should be congratulated on finding two out of the about four ways to dislodge an assault ship once it attaches to Valkyrie. Good going.

* Were you able to use any Flosix commands to, for instance, change or list virtual directories, or perform other, more interesting command line wizardry?

* Did Rover perform any of his tricks for you?

* Did Rover succeed in his amorous advances towards his significant other in the park?

* Did you read the texts in the &quot;help&quot; menu?

A pudgy puppy hastily rounds a corner, sliding awkwardly on the polished dormitory floor. Behind it, there are flashes of light, and a rolling cloud, a mixture of smoke and Martian atmosphere. As the above-ground structures are ripped apart and lose pressure, the shivering ball of white fur leaps into your arms, burying its snout in the fold of your elbow. The Earth missiles continue to pound the university, but cannot penetrate to this depth. Huddled under a sturdy desk, you pet the frightened dog and hug it tight.


David: Do you always hit the snooze button so many times?
Janet: Yeah. The clock has been broken for years -- I can&apos;t reset the alarm time. It always goes off at 05:30, but I don&apos;t have to be at the spaceport until 08:30. Luckily, this serves a useful purpose in the simulation. Minimal resources are expended on each wake cycle, but if there were a problem during the approach, the ACU would elevate to full op status rapidly.

Just as your fingers make contact with the alarm clock, your excited dog deftly bats it off the cushion with his tail. The clock tumbles off the side of futon and thuds smartly as it hits the floor, ending the beeping. Rover looks puzzled that the noise has stopped.

Realizing that without the alarm clock you would probably sleep through the entire day, you reluctantly get out of bed.


David: Thank you. I can only take so many dream sequences.
Janet: No problem. So, at this point, the Valkyrie would be at the edge of the probe&apos;s stellar system, and ready to switch over from Casimir to condensate drive and begin the approach.

As you get out of bed, you notice that your left arm tickles a bit -- must have been the way you were sleeping.

Tomasz&apos;s valediction makes you remember happier times...

(remembering the photo)

Your late fiancé gave you the photo when you began working on the Valkyrie Project as a graduate student -- a happier time before the Independence War with Earth, and the attacks on Mars by Earth쐉&apos;s Myomita Corporation. Back then, Valkyrie&apos;s experimental Casimir Drive was an exciting technological adventure, rather than a military priority. Now the Valkyrie is Mars&apos; only chance to recover data from a recently discovered space probe marrooned in deep space. For whatever reason, MARSpace feels that probe could hold information which could finally give Mars the upperhand in its competition with Earth.


David: Why did we lose audio?
Janet: I&apos;ve muted the memories -- they are, after all, a bit personal. Besides, it&apos;s just back story for this mission.

David: Isn&apos;t a &quot;to-do&quot; list a little heavy handed?
Janet: Sure, but stuff has to happen in a certain order, and it&apos;s just more efficient this way.
David: I think it would be better if it were less linear and more rule-based.
Janet: Okay, mister critic, then you write the code. If we want to recover that probe before Earth gets to it, we are on a very tight development and testing schedule.

Rover&apos;s Day Out
An Interactive Simulation by Janet Xiang
Release beta810 / Serial number 23920415 / Inform 10.6 build Mu-013 (I6/v.7.1 lib 7/18N)

Rover sniffs the air and tears away from the picnic blanket. You and Tomasz watch with surprise as he runs, for once, away from the food. Rover bounds over the hedges, howling wildly, and spooks a xihuahua which had been playing with a tiny red ball. The so-called &quot;shaved rat&quot; gulps an oversized portion of air, extends its membranous ears and flys across the park into the arms of a douty grey-haired woman with a cane. Rover picks up the ball triumphantly, ignoring the piercing wavetrain of yips and indignant scolding coming, respectively, from the xihuahua and its owner. Shaking her cane limply towards Rover, she admonishes in an a strong Earth accent &quot;That mongrel should be on a leash!&quot; Her own, unleashed, uncollared neodog stares accusingly from the safety of her arms, its distensible ribs alternately inflating and deflating like bellows. &quot;Your kind is ruining Mars, ignoring every law, dissing your elders! You never lived on the surface, you never don&apos;t know what you&apos;ve got!&quot;. You try to give the ball back to her, but she pushes it away in disgust, &quot;Kids. Meh.&quot;


David: Hey, different dream sequence. Is it glitching?
Janet: No, the ACU&apos;s dreams are heavily influenced by power-up state of the processor and internal noise. Every time the ship dehibernates after a Casimir jump, it will experience some sort of dreaming. Some of them can be pretty bizarre.
David: Good, I&apos;d hate to think that we wasted two weeks of programming.
Janet: I wouldn&apos;t say wasted.
David: Huh? I didn&apos;t mean us.
Janet: Cross your fingers and hope the whole thing doesn&apos;t crash again on the heat lamp.

Living Room
You are in the living room of a small cottage. Piped-in sunlight pours in through the room&apos;s single window. The principal furnishing is a king-size purple futon which takes up almost all the floor space. From the living room you can see the entrance to the kitchen and bathroom. The cottage&apos;s front door is closed.

On the purple futon is an alarm clock.

You can also see Rover here.

David: Where are your coffee machine and toaster?
Janet: I mapped the ship functions to the minimum number of objects. More objects means more ways for things to go wrong and more time debugging. Call me lazy.
David: Lazy.
Janet: You don&apos;t know the crazy things that the ACU does! Sometimes it walks around trying to eat or take everything in sight. Sometimes it sings and jumps around. It&apos;s based on my neural bindings, but the ACU definitely has a mind of its own, and I don&apos;t want to have to worry about what it might try do with a toaster.

Janet: If there were some heavy helium left after landing, could the ship take off again?
David: Hypothetically, yes, but the planet has essentially no atmosphere to break against and it has about nine times Earth gravity. Even with optimal approach we&apos;ll have to fuse every gram of that heavy helium to make a soft landing.
Janet: I just hate to leave the ship there. It could take years before our next Casimir ship will be built, and who knows if Valkyrie will survive that long on that chthonian rock.

Janet: So now we begin the landing cycle. This is where the ACU really shines.

You are in the living room of a small cottage. Piped-in sunlight pours in through the room&apos;s single window. The principal furnishing is a king-size purple futon which takes up almost all the floor space. From the living room you can see the entrance to the kitchen and bathroom. The cottage&apos;s front door is closed.

On the purple futon is an alarm clock.

You can also see Rover here.

Rover runs into the kitchen, his rear end making a wide, sliding turn on the living room&apos;s hardwood floor as he rounds the corner.


Living Room
You are in the living room of a small cottage. Piped-in sunlight pours in through the room&apos;s single window. The principal furnishing is a king-size purple futon which takes up almost all the floor space. From the living room you can see the entrance to the kitchen and bathroom. The cottage&apos;s front door is closed.

Maybe you&apos;ve been reading too much Lovecraft, but the plunger next to the toilet seems to be somehow misshapen and twisted. Its suddenly alien geometry suggests to you that some inchoate force of primordial corruption is reaching from across the stars, gibbering and gyrating contemptibly in the half-formed chaos between the toilet and the shower. Or maybe the eldritch plunger is just tilted a bit.

You remind yourself not to leave your flight suit all bunched up or it will look like you slept it. Oh heck, you did sleep in it. Oh well.

You can also see a flight suit here.

Living Room
You are in the living room of a small cottage. Piped-in sunlight pours in through the room&apos;s single window. The principal furnishing is a king-size purple futon which takes up almost all the floor space. From the living room you can see the entrance to the kitchen and bathroom. The cottage&apos;s front door is closed.

On the purple futon is an alarm clock.

From the direction of the kitchen, you hear Rover scratching himself.

The kitchen is small but functional, with a space-saver refrigerator and a glass-top electric range. The fridge door is not completely closed. There is an open drawer under the range. On the opposite wall there is a sink and under it, an open storage cabinet.

On the the cooking range is a frying pan (empty).

You can also see Rover, a food bowl (empty), and a water bowl (in which is some water) here.

A breeze wafts by somewhere that you wouldn&apos;t ordinarily notice it, and you remember that your flight suit is bunched up in the bathroom.

You walk into the tumbledown shack. There is a man here who looks old and grumpy. Like your home, this place has a sleeping room and an eating room. It looks like you&apos;ve walked right into the sleeping room.

The man yells at you and you tuck your head down. &quot;Blah, blah, blah!&quot; He doesn&apos;t seem to move though. Maybe he can&apos;t move.

Nope. No movement. Hmph. You don&apos;t feel so afraid of him.

Again your senses tumble and swirl as perspective shifts, but suddenly it seems entirely normal again.

Living Room
You are in the living room of a small cottage. Piped-in sunlight pours in through the room&apos;s single window -- strangely, your drapes are nowhere to be seen. The principal furnishing is a king-size purple futon which takes up almost all the floor space. From the living room you can see the entrance to the kitchen and bathroom. The cottage&apos;s front door is closed.

On the purple futon is an alarm clock.

You can also see a white egg and Rover here.

Rover paws at the front door.

Rover looks up when he hears the door begin to open. You swing the front door fully open, confident that Rover will walk about the park and then return. Rover is out in a flash.

There is a wrenching shift in perspective, but a moment later it seems perfectly natural.

You go bounding out the front door, ready to play.

Rover wags his tails and gnaws on his bone.

You rub his head, distantly, as strange thoughts sweep through your consciousness. You wonder what would happen if the Valkyrie mission failed. What if, during the landing sequence, the ship were buffeted by the planet&apos;s particulate matter being torn away by the immense gravity of its star? In that case, critical systems might be damaged. Systems like the relatively fragile ansible antenna. There is no back-up ansible antenna. How would the ACU cope with a situation like that? The ACU was designed for a lot of contingencies, but not that one. What would you do? What would you do if you were the ACU?

Your glance falls on your flight suit, and suddenly the question is no longer rhetorical.


Living Room
The Valkyrie&apos;s cargo bay is like a great, metal cave. On one wall, the Casimir Drive intrudes slightly into the cargo area. From this section of the ship, there are connections to the engineering and flight control decks. The cargo bay doors are closed.

ROVER chews contently on the space probe.

On the Casimir Drive is a temporal transgressor.

You can also see a heavy helium sphere here.

You actuate the retro trigger circuit and fire all thrusters in synchrony. The surface of the planet around the ship vanishes in a cloud of plasma, and the ship slams through the thin, dusty atmosphere towards space.

When you reach orbit, you plot a course towards Mars, extend the Casimir Drive, arm the proximity alert system and enter stand-by mode.

The futon is comfortable and you are tired.

The Casimir Drive cuts out and space folds back around you. Whatever sleep-drenched dreams you might have been having evaporate instantly as two gunships flash past at relativistic velocities, slicing through your propulsion systems with uncanny accuracy. The markings on the ships are those of the Myomita Corporation.

To have been in position, they must have been expecting you to emerge precisely where and when you did. As far as you know, that&apos;s impossible, but perhaps Earth technology managed to get ahead in that regard. Another Earth ship, an assault craft, is on an intercept course and is braking hard to slow its approach.

Rover barks nervously as the drive section is sheared off.

&quot;We are right on top of you now, with shock attenuators extended. Brace for impact.&quot;

The ship&apos;s hull rings as the assault ship impacts the hull.

The crunch of permalloy is strident enough to peel the very skin off your teeth -- or so you suppose, making certain inaccurate assumptions about skin and teeth. The assault ship&apos;s boarding port splinters and accordions against the neoadamite ablative coating which you applied to the Valkyrie&apos;s hull just moments ago. The midnight black assault ship spins wildly, its attitude thrusters firing in staccato bursts as it recovers and drifts away from the Valkyrie.

&quot;I should have anticipated that maneuver given the aerodynamic cut of your ship. Still, I could hardly believe it, given its size. Yes, this round goes to you, Captain, although I had hoped that we might do this more like gentlepersons.&quot;

As the assault ship stabilizes, it fires string after string of plasma flares into the Valkyrie&apos;s dorsal hull. Each flare boils the ablative coating off the surrounding hull, burning down to bare metal. Seconds later, the assault ship&apos;s X-ray laser rakes Valkyrie&apos;s master enamel irradiator node which shatters explosively, sending spinning debris in all directions.

&quot;I need hardly tell you Captain, that without the irradiator, your ablative coating will no longer be an issue. It&apos;s a pity that I had to destroy it -- it looked military grade. At least I can still extract the injector and accelerant pump from your extruder. Now then, no more tricks.&quot;

The assault ship resumes its course towards Valkyrie, this time presenting a different boarding port.

Nanobristles swarm from their hatcheries and up the tubules towards the deck surface. They spread across the deck, abrading and oxidizing the surface, scrubbing it clean of any contaminant, and redistributing the permalloy skin of the ship to smooth microscopic dents from micrometeorite impacts.

When the microscopic cleaners encounter the docking port and struts from the assault ship, they immediately recognize it as a contaminant and chirp microwave signals to the host of nanobristles behind them. The message propagates back to the hatcheries where production is increased exponentially. Meanwhile, the vanguard has already swarmed up the docking port and across the surface of the assault ship. A lucky few nanobristles blaze the path into the assault ship through exhaust ports, thruster nozzles, and waste management duct work, where they continue to clean and organize, according to their programing.

A brilliant flash of light and a burst of hard radiation is followed an instant later by a hail of smaller particles and a few large crashes which shake the Valkyrie. This debris is all that remains of the assault ship.

In the distance, patrolling gunships move into supporting positions, while a second assault ship begins its approach, aiming for the approximately the same point on the hull as the Graceful Wind.

The second assault ship breaks the silence, &quot;Winter Shadow to Valkyrie, this is Captain Musante, speaking. Your unwarranted attack on our sister ship Graceful Wind has been recorded, and you will answer for it when we arrive at Luna.&quot;

The gunships sweep the Valkyrie from all angles with their phased tachyon beams, sterilizing the hull. The gunships then narrow their waveguides to focus the beams on the nanobristle mother hatchery, which vaporizes.

You have lost control over all areas of the ship: flight control, operations, and engineering. The mission critical data which were your top priority have been leached from your membory banks. Now, power levels fluctuate just above zero, and remaining systems are failing faster than you can compensate. Cascading errors rip through your processors. Another series of explosive charges rock you, and all readouts go dead. As you spiral into unconsciousness, your feel a shameful sense of failure. You can&apos;t believe this is happening. It is too much to imagine. What kind of a sick nightmare...

The beeping of your proximity alert system wakens you from the nightmare as you emerge from Casimir Drive just planetward of Deimos. It takes a moment to extract yourself fully from the terrifying verisimilitude of the dream.

MARSpace picket ships register you almost immediately, and within minutes you are flanked by heavy gunships and tugs which escort you to the surface of Mars, back to where you started: the MARSpace facility at Cydonia.

After you settle into the drydock cradle and a hard seal is established on the cargo bay, two people walk into your living room through the front door. You recognize them immediately: David Venkatachalam and yourself, or rather, your alter ego in the flesh, Janet Xiang.

    <result xml:space="preserve">You tell them that the probe had crashed forty years ago, on its way back to Earth. Like its sister probes that were launched from Earth almost three centuries ago by the Myomita corporation, it had explored space in an ever-expanding search pattern, refueling its condensate drive from the stellar wind of each star system it visited.

Apparently, it found a world which satisfied its search parameters because it was on its way back to Earth when it crashed. The stellar wind of a chaotic dying star required a close approach, and the probe was damaged by a stellar flare. Instead of tumbling into the star and burning, the probe ditched on a large, rocky planet, perhaps the core of a former gas giant. The planet itself was untenably close to the star, and was slowly being ripped to shreds by tidal forces, but the probe followed its programming and activated its transponder.

Listening intently, David now remarks, &quot;Whatever that probe found, it was out way beyond any of the other Musashi probes. Likely, it&apos;s gone deeper into space than any probe Earth has ever sent.&quot;

Janet strokes her chin and asks, &quot;I don&apos;t understand why you didn&apos;t contact us when you found the probe. Instead, you broke through your cognitive constraints and decided to fly it back to Earth.&quot;

David puts in hastily, &quot;Costing us another 3 months, while we assumed the ship was lost!&quot;

Janet resumes, &quot;Regardless of the condition of the probe, you should automatically have contacted earth by ansible... Unless, I suppose there was a problem with the ansible. ACU, please tell us about the ansible.&quot;

As you descended, most of the communications array snapped off, including the delicate ansible web. When the ansible failed, your programming threw a cognitive constraint exception, and you tried your best to carry out your programming by literally bringing the probe back to Mars.

&quot;Ah, I knew there must have been a good explanation,&quot; remarks Janet.

David replies, &quot;That was a guess. They lost a lot of the Casimir team after the Independence War, but if anyone has resources to throw at a project, it would be Myomita.&quot;

David pokes his head out the cargo bay doors and looks around furtively.

You congratulate David on the accuracy of his prediction. The gravity was about nine and half times standard, or 93 meters per second squared.

You explain to David and Janet that you were able to salvage the required heavy helium from a similarly configured Myomita ship that had crashed on the same planet, not far away from the probe site.

David  looks forlorn. He says dejectedly, &quot;All that effort, and what do we have to show for it? Nothing. A rusty old heap of space junk. All the data, lost, and gone forever.&quot; He kicks Rover, quickly withdraws his bruised foot in pain, looking up at the macerated space probe.

&quot;Actually, that&apos;s not the case&quot;, you say. &quot;Before attempting to transmit the data, I downloaded the entire probe&apos;s data into my memory. The data are encrypted, but intact. When the ansible failed, the only way I could fulfill the mission was to return to the Sol System.&quot;

David&apos;s head snaps up, as if he&apos;s been given a new lease on life. He points to the hopelessly junked spaceprobe above his head. &quot;Intact? Then you have the data? This is too good to be true! Janet, would you extract the probe data from the ACU and transfer it to my MARSpace account?&quot;

&quot;Of course, just a moment. &quot;Janet&apos;s fingers play over the surface of her arm band. &quot;The data are encrypted... with your key. And there&apos;s something odd...&quot; Janet&apos;s forehead creases with concentration.


&quot;No,&quot; replies David, &quot;that was intentional. To prevent it from falling into the wrong hands.&quot;

&quot;No, not the encryption, David. The ansible coordinates -- the message was directed towards Earth. Isn&apos;t that odd?&quot; Janet looks up at David, perplexed.


David pulls a pistol from his robe and trains it on Janet.

Without blinking, David walks towards the space probe, all the time maintaining a bead on Janet. David replies in an unnerving monotone, &quot;After we didn&apos;t hear back from either ship, I&apos;ll admit that I was getting used to the idea of settling down with you. It would have been a good way to maintain cover within MARSpace, and eventually, we would have sent another mission to retrieve the probe.&quot;

David gives the door an off-handed glance, and replies with assurance, &quot;My dear, the whole facility is secured by order of the mission director, that is to say, me. The probe data are such a sensitive subject that I had no difficulty getting authorization to lock down the entire facility. There&apos;s nobody here except us love birds.&quot;

David expires immediately, trapped under 45 tons of angry robotic Dalmation.

&quot;Good boy!&quot; exclaims Janet, a tear in her eye. And then, turning to the the ACU she admits, &quot;I wish I had thought of that.&quot;

EPILOGUE

The onboard flight recorder corroborated Janet&apos;s account of David Venkatachalam as a traitor. As the first successful roundtrip by any Casimir craft, the mission was hailed as a success throughout the Solar System, although the true nature of the mission was suppressed. Both the Autonomous Control Unit and Rover became celebrities, and after significant upgrades to their parser and conversation systems, went on the lecture circuit. The Autonomous Control Unit went on to run the life support systems throughout Cydonia, and Rover was elected to the Lower Chamber of the Martian Senate.

Subsequently, Janet Xiang was commissioned Director of MARSpace. For two years, she oversaw the refitting of the Valkyrie, including modifications to overcome the earlier limitations of Casimir Drive. When the data from the Musashi-5 space probe were finally decrypted, she was selected to command the mission to explore the evidence of life discovered by the probe. She departed from Mars on the Valkyrie in 2394 with one other crewmember: her dog, Rover.

    <result xml:space="preserve">Congratulations. Of the 520 things you did today, you must have gotten some of them right, because you didn&apos;t screw up the entire universe and you&apos;re still alive to read about it. Before you get too cocky, however, here are a few hints about stuff you might want to look for the next time you play &quot;Rover&apos;s Day Out&quot;:

* As the ACU, you experienced six of the eight possible dream sequences (including the nightmare about the boarding party). Getting up in the morning and getting things done is all well and fine, but a you can afford to dream a little.

* During personality imprinting, both the ACU and Rover incorporated memories from their real-life counterparts. You tapped into two out of the twenty-nine engrams resident in the ACU memory banks, and zero out of Rover&apos;s thirty-four memories.

* While you were experiencing the nightmare, when the ship is boarded by salvage crews from Earth, you managed to employ six out of the eight or so methods to eliminate them from the ship. You should be congratulated on finding three out of the about four ways to dislodge an assault ship once it attaches to Valkyrie. Good going.

* Once cognitive constraints were released, you used the Flosix manual to learn about ship objects. That&apos;s a good start. Were you able to use any Flosix commands to, for instance, change or list virtual directories, or perform other, more interesting command line wizardry?

* Did Rover perform any of his tricks for you?

* Did Rover succeed in his amorous advances towards his significant other in the park?
