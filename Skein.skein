Rover&apos;s Day Out
An Interactive Simulation by Janet Xiang
Release beta 732 / Serial number 23920401 / Inform 10.6 build Mu-013 (I6/v.7.1 lib 7/18N)

Rover draws pensively on his stubby cigar, the tip glowing red below his dealer&apos;s hat. He paws nonchalantly at the scotch and water he has been nursing for the last half hour. Despite the tower of chips in front of him, he&apos;s either in trouble now, or trying to play the rest of the table for suckers. His tail is no longer wagging, though, and you suspect that the scotch may be getting the better of him. He can&apos;t mass more than about 30 kilos, and he&apos;s been putting them away tonight. You push all in, figuring that even if you lose it all, at least you&apos;ll get some sleep before you need to get back to the MARSpace. Elva the cleaning lady folds, as does Isaac Asimov and that boy that you kissed in fourth grade. Wait...don&apos;t go....where is everyone going?


David: You have some weird dreams.
Janet: You can&apos;t hold me responsible for the subconscious ramblings of the ACU.

Rover&apos;s Day Out
An Interactive Simulation by Janet Xiang
Release beta810 / Serial number 23920415 / Inform 10.6 build Mu-013 (I6/v.7.1 lib 7/18N)

Rover sniffs the air and tears away from the picnic blanket. You and Tomasz watch with surprise as he runs, for once, away from the food. Rover bounds over the hedges, howling wildly, and spooks a xihuahua which had been playing with a tiny red ball. The so-called &quot;shaved rat&quot; gulps an oversized portion of air, extends its membranous ears and flys across the park into the arms of a douty grey-haired woman with a cane. Rover picks up the ball triumphantly, ignoring the piercing wavetrain of yips and indignant scolding coming, respectively, from the xihuahua and its owner. Shaking her cane limply towards Rover, she admonishes in an a strong Earth accent &quot;That mongrel should be on a leash!&quot; Her own, unleashed, uncollared neodog stares accusingly from the safety of her arms, its distensible ribs alternately inflating and deflating like bellows. &quot;Your kind is ruining Mars, ignoring every law, dissing your elders! You never lived on the surface, you never don&apos;t know what you&apos;ve got!&quot;. You try to give the ball back to her, but she pushes it away in disgust, &quot;Kids. Meh.&quot;


David: Hey, different dream sequence. Is it glitching?
Janet: No, the ACU&apos;s dreams are heavily influenced by power-up state of the processor and internal noise. Every time the ship dehibernates after a Casimir jump, it will experience some sort of dreaming. Some of them can be pretty bizarre.
David: Good, I&apos;d hate to think that we wasted two weeks of programming.
Janet: I wouldn&apos;t say wasted.
David: Huh? I didn&apos;t mean us.
Janet: Cross your fingers and hope the whole thing doesn&apos;t crash again on the heat lamp.

David: How about a plate and fork?
Janet: The ACU doesn&apos;t miss them, and it&apos;s less programming overhead. And bonus: fewer dishes to clean.

Rover narrows his eyes critically, noting the lack of food in his food bowl. He looks at you with imploring puppy dog eyes and then back again at his empty food bowl.

Janet: The ACU works so fast that no matter how many individual steps it takes, the effect occurs at the right time.

Janet: When Rover brings the probe back to the ship, it will automatically extract the data and send it back by ansible. Did you enter the ansible parameters?
David: Yes, I had to do it manually since the frequency and coordinates are encrypted. It&apos;s too bad they didn&apos;t have FTL communications when they built the probes - it would have saved us the trip.

Janet: So, that&apos;s it. Rover goes out, gets the probe, brings it back to the ship, and then the information is squirted back to MARSpace.
David: Well, congratulations, Doctor Xiang, on a job well done. I say we celebrate tonight, and get up early for the launch tomorrow morning.

Rover&apos;s Day Out
An Interactive Simulation by Janet Xiang and David Venkatachalam
Release 1 / Serial number 23920416 / Inform 10.6 build Mu-013 (I6/v.7.1 lib 7/18N)

Even mildly drugged and reclining on an overstuffed couch in the MARSpace human resources office, it&apos;s hard to relax in the presence of the MARSpace political officer conducting the final interview. You didn&apos;t catch her name, probably because she never mentioned it. After three such interviews and six months of background check, what more could they want?  

&quot;Ms. Xiang, thank you for your cooperation. Your tests show no hint of disloyalty to the Republic or MARSpace. We hope you understand the need for these measures, particularly for personnel with access to the Valkyrie&apos;s command and control functions. Now that you are cleared, I can inform you that credible sources have warned that the project may have been infiltrated by...&quot;

&lt;BEEP&gt; &lt;BEEP&gt; &lt;BEEP&gt;

You weren&apos;t particularly enjoying this dream, but being jarred awake by a violently shaking futon is even less pleasurable.

As the bed bucks and tumbles, several scenarios flash through your mind: explosive decompression of the dome? Volcanic activity? Meteor impact? Before you can even consider your next action, you are thrown from the futon onto the living room floor. Light pours in from the window. It looks like the drapes were somehow torn away from the window.

Rover wags his tails and gnaws on his bone.

You rub his head, distantly, as strange thoughts sweep through your consciousness. You wonder what would happen if the Valkyrie mission failed. What if, during the landing sequence, the ship were buffeted by the planet&apos;s particulate matter being torn away by the immense gravity of its star? In that case, critical systems might be damaged. Systems like the relatively fragile ansible antenna. There is no back-up ansible antenna. How would the ACU cope with a situation like that? The ACU was designed for a lot of contingencies, but not that one. What would you do? What would you do if you were the ACU?

Your glance falls on your flight suit, and suddenly the question is no longer rhetorical.


Living Room
The Valkyrie&apos;s cargo bay is like a great, metal cave. On one wall, the Casimir Drive intrudes slightly into the cargo area. From this section of the ship, there are connections to the engineering and flight control decks. The cargo bay doors are closed.

ROVER chews contently on the space probe.

You can also see a heavy helium sphere and a temporal transgressor here.

The message propagates back to the hatcheries where production is increased exponentially. Meanwhile, the vanguard has already swarmed up the docking port and across the surface of the assault ship. A lucky few nanobristles blaze the path into the assault ship through exhaust ports, thruster nozzles, and waste management duct work, where they continue to clean and organize, according to their programing.

A brilliant flash of light and a burst of hard radiation is followed an instant later by a hail of smaller particles and a few large crashes which shake the Valkyrie. This debris is all that remains of the assault ship.

In the distance, patrolling gunships move into supporting positions, while a second assault ship begins its approach, aiming for the approximately the same point on the hull as the Graceful Wind.

The second assault ship breaks the silence, &quot;Winter Shadow to Valkyrie, this is Captain Musante, speaking. Your unwarranted attack on our sister ship Graceful Wind has been recorded, and you will answer for it when we arrive at Luna.&quot;

The gunships sweep the Valkyrie from all angles with their phased tachyon beams, sterilizing the hull. The gunships then narrow their waveguides to focus the beams on the nanobristle mother hatchery, which vaporizes.

The ship&apos;s hull rings as the assault ship impacts the hull.

The crunch of permalloy is strident enough to peel the very skin off your teeth -- or so you suppose, making certain inaccurate assumptions about skin and teeth. The assault ship&apos;s boarding port splinters and accordions against the neoadamite ablative coating which you applied to the Valkyrie&apos;s hull just moments ago. The midnight black assault ship spins wildly, its attitude thrusters firing in staccato bursts as it recovers and drifts away from the Valkyrie.

&quot;I should have anticipated that maneuver given the aerodynamic cut of your ship. Still, I could hardly believe it, given its size. Yes, this round goes to you, Captain, although I had hoped that we might do this more like gentlepersons.&quot;

As the assault ship stabilizes, it fires string after string of plasma flares into the Valkyrie&apos;s dorsal hull. Each flare boils the ablative coating off the surrounding hull, burning down to bare metal. Seconds later, the assault ship&apos;s X-ray laser rakes Valkyrie&apos;s master enamel irradiator node which shatters explosively, sending spinning debris in all directions.

&quot;I need hardly tell you Captain, that without the irradiator, your ablative coating will no longer be an issue. It&apos;s a pity that I had to destroy it -- it looked military grade. At least I can still extract the injector and accelerant pump from your extruder. Now then, no more tricks.&quot;

The assault ship resumes its course towards Valkyrie, this time presenting a different boarding port.

You can also see a maintenance droid and a quantum isolator here.

The maintenance droid glances away from his work for a moment, and then does a double take, gaping first at your retracted quantum isolation shield and then at your unusually large transputational core frothed with quantum foam, and ringed by a halo of dark matter.

It turns out to be more raw processing power than the old boy can handle, and the robot&apos;s own quantum ganglia scintillate wildly before showering the deck in an embarassing fountain of sparks and molten metal.

You realize that without a functional avionics hub, it will be almost impossible to complete your mission of delivering the probe data to Mars.

You try to calm yourself by remembering that without heavy helium, the fusion rockets are of no use to you anyhow.

Along one wall is the coolant output terminus, and below that the fuel storage vault, which is not properly secured. The opened reactor core and the fusion chamber are stacked just to the side of the cryochamber, which maintains the stabilized heavy helium fuel at near absolute zero until it is needed to provide power to ascent/descent retros.

On the fusion chamber is a magnetic bottle (empty).

You can also see a coolant reservoir (empty), a fuel reservoir (empty), and ROVER here.

Having done enough damage in the extruder chamber, the intruder seems to have started its ascent towards the engineering deck

Your thoughts race, as you try to come up with a plan to dislodge the assault ship from your hull or take some kind of vengence on the intruder that is slowly gutting you from within.

Your thoughts drift back to Mars for a moment, and you think about how disappointed Janet will be, heck, all of Mars would be, if the probe data are captured by Earth. You resolve to put up the best fight you can, for as long as you last.

The maintenance droid carefully turns the corner into the kitchen and looks around. Extending the antenna of his radio to get through the heavy shielding on the engineering deck, the maintenance droid radios, &quot;Winter Shadow from maintenance droid: Just checking in. I&apos;m in the engineering section. No contacts.&quot;

&quot;Roger, maintenance droid. Telemetry is still five-by-five. Winter Shadow standing by.&quot;

It occurs to you that if the Earth ships detected your Casimir disruption, it is just as likely that Mars did as well. Certainly, MARSpace has the equipment to sense a Casimir emergence out to the heliopause, and the Casimir disruption would propagate almost instantaneously. You perk up, buoyed by the thought that Mars may already be taking action on your behalf. Of course, that action would have to move pretty damn fast to get here before you are more than a pile of scrap metal.

ROVER vents some noxious fumes near the maintenance droid who takes the hint and moves further away from Rover.

ROVER is definitely down for the count, but you assume there is no permanent damage. The same can&apos;t be said of the maintenance droid, which you dispose of. ROVER may be unconscious, but the space probe remains clamped in his jaws.

The flexible tubing that connects the assault ship&apos;s boarding port to the hole in Valkyrie&apos;s deck undulates, suggesting that someone else is coming board. Shortly thereafter, your sensors determine that something is moving towards the kitchen.

You find it difficult to swallow as your throat seizes up, choking you. You struggle to breathe and are overwhelmed by the hindbrain reflexes running at high priority in the overlay. Slowly, you fight for control and push the simulation to background while assessing the damage. The magnetic containment system in the fusion reactor is no longer responding to diagnostics. It too has gone offline.

You consider yourself lucky that they are going after the fusion engines rather than more critical systems. Without flight control and the extruder, it&apos;s not like you&apos;d be in any position to attempt a planetary landing even if you did have the fusion fuel to burn. You consider the possibility that they don&apos;t know the nature of your payload and really are just interested in salvage.

Shiny lights dance around in your video input, and you feel nauseous. This is exactly the kind of migraine you get after a long tube ride on Mars. The noise from the engineering section isn&apos;t helping, either. You try to concentrate. Engineering systems. Diagnostics. The cryochamber has been disabled.

You scan local space and are relieved that no more ships have arrived. Still, between the gunships and the assault craft, it would take a sizable Martian fleet to even the odds. Moving full flank on condensate drive, maybe they could reach you in a few hours. By that time, though, it&apos;s almost a certainty that reinforcements would from arrive from Earth.

You think about your main mission objective, of getting the probe data back to Mars. You wonder recursively what Janet would do in your shoes. No doubt she&apos;d fight as long as she could, and then find a way to make the best of the situation. In this case, maybe preventing Earth from getting the data would be the next best thing to fulfilling your mission directive.

You know that certain interdictions are deeply embedded in your programming: you can&apos;t harm a human (directly, anyhow, although you are willing to take some license with that particular interdiction), you can&apos;t self-destruct, and you can&apos;t erase the probe data from your deep memory.

The Bogdanov puts itself between you and the remaining Myomita gunships, and its pressor beam gives a strong shove towards an expensive Mars transfer orbit.

Like its sister probes that were launched from Earth almost three centuries ago by the Myomita corporation, it had explored space in an ever-expanding search pattern, refueling its condensate drive from the stellar wind of each star system it visited.

Apparently, it found a world which satisfied its search parameters because it was on its way back to Earth when it crashed. The stellar wind of a chaotic dying star required a close approach, and the probe was damaged by a stellar flare. Instead of tumbling into the star and burning, the probe ditched on a large, rocky planet, perhaps the core of a former gas giant. The planet itself was untenably close to the star, and was slowly being ripped to shreds by tidal forces, but the probe followed its programming and activated its transponder.

Listening intently, David now remarks, &quot;Whatever that probe found, it was out way beyond any of the other Musashi probes. Likely, it&apos;s gone deeper into space than any probe Earth has ever sent.&quot;

Janet strokes her chin and asks, &quot;I don&apos;t understand why you didn&apos;t contact us when you found the probe. Instead, you broke through your cognitive constraints and decided to fly it back to Earth.&quot;

David puts in hastily, &quot;Costing us another 3 months, while we assumed the ship was lost!&quot;

Janet resumes, &quot;Regardless of the condition of the probe, you should automatically have contacted earth by ansible... Unless, I suppose there was a problem with the ansible. ACU, please tell us about the ansible.&quot;

Rover slowly opens one eye, and then the other, and one paw abandons the bone momentarily to scratch his ear. He allows the bone to loll to one side of his mouth, and crunches it a bit more between his molars. He awakens leisurely, and sits up, glancing curiously at you, and then at Janet.

When the ansible failed, your programming threw a cognitive constraint exception, and you tried your best to carry out your programming by literally bringing the probe back to Mars.

You congratulate David on the accuracy of his prediction. The gravity was about nine and half times standard, or 93 meters per second squared.

&quot;What?&quot; cries David in surprise, &quot;You wouldn&apos;t have had enough fusion fuel to get back into space!&quot;

You explain to David and Janet that you were able to salvage the required heavy helium from a similarly configured Myomita ship that had crashed on the same planet, not far away from the probe site.

Janet inspects the parser module and tweaks it slightly.

ROVER chews contently on his bone.

David  looks forlorn. He says dejectedly, &quot;All that effort, and what do we have to show for it? Nothing. A rusty old heap of space junk. All the data, lost, and gone forever.&quot; He kicks Rover, quickly withdraws his bruised foot in pain, looking up at the macerated space probe.

&quot;Actually, that&apos;s not the case&quot;, you say. &quot;Before attempting to transmit the data, I downloaded the entire probe&apos;s data into my memory. The data are encrypted, but intact. When the ansible failed, the only way I could fulfill the mission was to return to the Sol System.&quot;

David&apos;s head snaps up, as if he&apos;s been given a new lease on life. David points to the hopelessly junked spaceprobe above his head. &quot;Intact? Then you have the data? This is too good to be true! Janet, would you extract the probe data from the ACU and transfer it to my MARSpace account?&quot;

&quot;Of course, just a moment. &quot;Janet&apos;s fingers play over the surface of her arm band. &quot;The data are encrypted... with your key. And there&apos;s something odd...&quot; Janet&apos;s forehead creases with concentration.


&quot;No,&quot; replies David, &quot;that was intentional. To prevent it from falling into the wrong hands.&quot;

&quot;No, not the encryption, David. The ansible coordinates -- the message was directed towards Earth. Isn&apos;t that odd?&quot; Janet looks up at David, perplexed.


David pulls a pistol from his robe and trains it on Janet.

David replies in an unnerving monotone, &quot;After we didn&apos;t hear back from either ship, I&apos;ll admit that I was getting used to the idea of settling down with you. It would have been a good way to maintain cover within MARSpace, and eventually, we would have sent another mission to retrieve the probe.&quot;

David expires immediately, trapped under 45 tons of angry robotic Dalmation.

&quot;Good boy!&quot; exclaims Janet, a tear in her eye. And then, turning to the the ACU she admits, &quot;I wish I had thought of that.&quot;

EPILOGUE

The onboard flight recorder corroborated Janet&apos;s account of David Venkatachalam as a traitor. As the first successful roundtrip by any Casimir craft, the mission was hailed as a success throughout the Solar System, although the true nature of the mission was suppressed. Both the Autonomous Control Unit and Rover became celebrities, and after significant upgrades to their parser and conversation systems, went on the lecture circuit. The Autonomous Control Unit went on to run the life support systems throughout Cydonia, and Rover was elected to the Lower Chamber of the Martian Senate.

Subsequently, Janet Xiang was commissioned Director of MARSpace. For two years, she oversaw the refitting of the Valkyrie, including modifications to overcome the earlier limitations of Casimir Drive. When the data from the Musashi-5 space probe were finally decrypted, she was selected to command the mission to explore the evidence of life discovered by the probe. She departed from Mars on the Valkyrie in 2394 with one other crewmember: her dog, Rover.

    <result xml:space="preserve">Congratulations. Of the 187 things you did today, you must have gotten some of them right, because you didn&apos;t screw up the entire universe and you&apos;re still alive to read about it. Before you get too cocky, however, here are a few hints about stuff you might want to look for the next time you play &quot;Rover&apos;s Day Out&quot;:

* As the ACU, you experienced four of the seven possible dream sequences . Getting up in the morning and getting things done is all well and fine, but a you can afford to dream a little.

* During personality imprinting, both the ACU and Rover incorporated memories from their real-life counterparts. You tapped into zero out of the twenty-nine engrams resident in the ACU memory banks, and zero out of Rover&apos;s thirty-four memories.

* When the Myomita merchant marine ships intercepted you on the way back to Mars, you managed to employ four out of the eight or so methods to eliminate them from the ship. You should be congratulated on finding two out of the about four ways to dislodge an assault ship once it attaches to Valkyrie. Good going.

* Were you able to use any Flosix commands to, for instance, change or list virtual directories, or perform other, more interesting command line wizardry?

* Did Rover perform any of his tricks for you?

* Did Rover succeed in his amorous advances towards his significant other in the park?

* Did you read the texts in the &quot;help&quot; menu?

The Earth missiles continue to pound the university, but cannot penetrate to this depth. Huddled under a sturdy desk, you pet the frightened dog and hug it tight.

Tomasz&apos;s valediction makes you remember happier times...

(remembering the photo)

Your late fiancé gave you the photo when you began working on the Valkyrie Project as a graduate student -- a happier time before the Independence War with Earth, and the attacks on Mars by Earth쐉&apos;s Myomita Corporation. Back then, Valkyrie&apos;s experimental Casimir Drive was an exciting technological adventure, rather than a military priority. Now the Valkyrie is Mars&apos; only chance to recover data from a recently discovered space probe marrooned in deep space. For whatever reason, MARSpace feels that probe could hold information which could finally give Mars the upperhand in its competition with Earth.


David: Why did we lose audio?
Janet: I&apos;ve muted the memories -- they are, after all, a bit personal. Besides, it&apos;s just back story for this mission.

Rover bounds up onto the futon and begins to get comfortable, rolling his muzzle back and forth on the mattress. Abruptly, his head pokes up and he realizes that you are watching him. Recognizing the awkwardness of being caught on the forbidden futon, Rover slinks down behind it and slowly emerges.

David: Is the static charge neutralization part of the script?

We can&apos;t, for instance, know that Valkyrie will accumulate a static charge in a particular area, so the ACU has to be flexible enough to react to unpredictable events.

Rover&apos;s Day Out
An Interactive Simulation by Janet Xiang
Release beta810 / Serial number 23920415 / Inform 10.6 build Mu-013 (I6/v.7.1 lib 7/18N)

Rover sniffs the air and tears away from the picnic blanket. You and Tomasz watch with surprise as he runs, for once, away from the food. Rover bounds over the hedges, howling wildly, and spooks a xihuahua which had been playing with a tiny red ball. The so-called &quot;shaved rat&quot; gulps an oversized portion of air, extends its membranous ears and flys across the park into the arms of a douty grey-haired woman with a cane. Rover picks up the ball triumphantly, ignoring the piercing wavetrain of yips and indignant scolding coming, respectively, from the xihuahua and its owner. Shaking her cane limply towards Rover, she admonishes in an a strong Earth accent &quot;That mongrel should be on a leash!&quot; Her own, unleashed, uncollared neodog stares accusingly from the safety of her arms, its distensible ribs alternately inflating and deflating like bellows. &quot;Your kind is ruining Mars, ignoring every law, dissing your elders! You never lived on the surface, you never don&apos;t know what you&apos;ve got!&quot;. You try to give the ball back to her, but she pushes it away in disgust, &quot;Kids. Meh.&quot;


David: Hey, different dream sequence. Is it glitching?
Janet: No, the ACU&apos;s dreams are heavily influenced by power-up state of the processor and internal noise. Every time the ship dehibernates after a Casimir jump, it will experience some sort of dreaming. Some of them can be pretty bizarre.
David: Good, I&apos;d hate to think that we wasted two weeks of programming.
Janet: I wouldn&apos;t say wasted.
David: Huh? I didn&apos;t mean us.
Janet: Cross your fingers and hope the whole thing doesn&apos;t crash again on the heat lamp.

Living Room
You are in the living room of a small cottage. Piped-in sunlight pours in through the room&apos;s single window. The principal furnishing is a king-size purple futon which takes up almost all the floor space. From the living room you can see the entrance to the kitchen and bathroom. The cottage&apos;s front door is closed.

On the purple futon is an alarm clock.

You can also see Rover here.

Janet: If there were some heavy helium left after landing, could the ship take off again?
David: Hypothetically, yes, but the planet has essentially no atmosphere to break against and it has about nine times Earth gravity. Even with optimal approach we&apos;ll have to fuse every gram of that heavy helium to make a soft landing.
Janet: I just hate to leave the ship there. It could take years before our next Casimir ship will be built, and who knows if Valkyrie will survive that long on that chthonian rock.

Janet: So now we begin the landing cycle. This is where the ACU really shines.

David: No, I mean the Norway Spruce, over there.

David: I concede. Can we make up now?

Rover seems relaxed.

Rover can be a messy eater.  By force of habit you never bring dog bowls out of the kitchen, so you set them down before continuing on your way.

Rover runs into the kitchen, his rear end making a wide, sliding turn on the living room&apos;s hardwood floor as he rounds the corner.


Living Room
You are in the living room of a small cottage. Piped-in sunlight pours in through the room&apos;s single window. The principal furnishing is a king-size purple futon which takes up almost all the floor space. From the living room you can see the entrance to the kitchen and bathroom.

Maybe you&apos;ve been reading too much Lovecraft, but the plunger next to the toilet seems to be somehow misshapen and twisted. Its suddenly alien geometry suggests to you that some inchoate force of primordial corruption is reaching from across the stars, gibbering and gyrating contemptibly in the half-formed chaos between the toilet and the shower. Or maybe the eldritch plunger is just tilted a bit.

You remind yourself not to leave your flight suit all bunched up or it will look like you slept it. Oh heck, you did sleep in it. Oh well.

The man yells at you and you tuck your head down. &quot;Blah, blah, blah!&quot; He doesn&apos;t seem to move though. Maybe he can&apos;t move.

Nope. No movement. Hmph. You don&apos;t feel so afraid of him.

Rover looks up when he hears the door begin to open. You swing the front door fully open, confident that Rover will walk about the park and then return. Rover is out in a flash.

There is a wrenching shift in perspective, but a moment later it seems perfectly natural.

You go bounding out the front door, ready to play. 

Front Yard
The scent of your house is strong here, and you are right next to its front door. You can&apos;t see far because it is so dusty here. The wind picks up, making it even more difficult to see.

Rover wags his tails and gnaws on his bone.

You rub his head, distantly, as strange thoughts sweep through your consciousness. You wonder what would happen if the Valkyrie mission failed. What if, during the landing sequence, the ship were buffeted by the planet&apos;s particulate matter being torn away by the immense gravity of its star? In that case, critical systems might be damaged. Systems like the relatively fragile ansible antenna. There is no back-up ansible antenna. How would the ACU cope with a situation like that? The ACU was designed for a lot of contingencies, but not that one. What would you do? What would you do if you were the ACU?

Your glance falls on your flight suit, and suddenly the question is no longer rhetorical.


Living Room
The Valkyrie&apos;s cargo bay is like a great, metal cave. On one wall, the Casimir Drive intrudes slightly into the cargo area. From this section of the ship, there are connections to the engineering and flight control decks. The cargo bay doors are closed.

ROVER chews contently on the space probe.

On the Casimir Drive is a temporal transgressor.

You can also see a heavy helium sphere here.

ROVER chews contently on the space probe.

You actuate the retro trigger circuit and fire all thrusters in synchrony. The surface of the planet around the ship vanishes in a cloud of plasma, and the ship slams through the thin, dusty atmosphere towards space.

When you reach orbit, you plot a course towards Mars, extend the Casimir Drive, arm the proximity alert system and enter stand-by mode.

The futon is comfortable and you are tired.

The Casimir Drive cuts out and space folds back around you. Whatever sleep-drenched dreams you might have been having evaporate instantly as two gunships flash past at relativistic velocities, slicing through your propulsion systems with uncanny accuracy. The markings on the ships are those of the Myomita Corporation.

To have been in position, they must have been expecting you to emerge precisely where and when you did. As far as you know, that&apos;s impossible, but perhaps Earth technology managed to get ahead in that regard. Another Earth ship, an assault craft, is on an intercept course and is braking hard to slow its approach.

    <result xml:space="preserve">The UV light diffuses over the entire surface of the ship and causes the chemical mixture on the hull to polymerize into an durable, clear ablative coating.

&quot;We are right on top of you now, with shock attenuators extended. Brace for impact.&quot;

The ship&apos;s hull rings as the assault ship impacts the hull.

The crunch of permalloy is strident enough to peel the very skin off your teeth -- or so you suppose, making certain inaccurate assumptions about skin and teeth. The assault ship&apos;s boarding port splinters and accordions against the neoadamite ablative coating which you applied to the Valkyrie&apos;s hull just moments ago. The midnight black assault ship spins wildly, its attitude thrusters firing in staccato bursts as it recovers and drifts away from the Valkyrie.

&quot;I should have anticipated that maneuver given the aerodynamic cut of your ship. Still, I could hardly believe it, given its size. Yes, this round goes to you, Captain, although I had hoped that we might do this more like gentlepersons.&quot;

As the assault ship stabilizes, it fires string after string of plasma flares into the Valkyrie&apos;s dorsal hull. Each flare boils the ablative coating off the surrounding hull, burning down to bare metal. Seconds later, the assault ship&apos;s X-ray laser rakes Valkyrie&apos;s master enamel irradiator node which shatters explosively, sending spinning debris in all directions.

&quot;I need hardly tell you Captain, that without the irradiator, your ablative coating will no longer be an issue. It&apos;s a pity that I had to destroy it -- it looked military grade. At least I can still extract the injector and accelerant pump from your extruder. Now then, no more tricks.&quot;

The assault ship resumes its course towards Valkyrie, this time presenting a different boarding port.

Nanobristles swarm from their hatcheries and up the tubules towards the deck surface. They spread across the deck, abrading and oxidizing the surface, scrubbing it clean of any contaminant, and redistributing the permalloy skin of the ship to smooth microscopic dents from micrometeorite impacts.

When the microscopic cleaners encounter the docking port and struts from the assault ship, they immediately recognize it as a contaminant and chirp microwave signals to the host of nanobristles behind them. The message propagates back to the hatcheries where production is increased exponentially. Meanwhile, the vanguard has already swarmed up the docking port and across the surface of the assault ship. A lucky few nanobristles blaze the path into the assault ship through exhaust ports, thruster nozzles, and waste management duct work, where they continue to clean and organize, according to their programing.

A brilliant flash of light and a burst of hard radiation is followed an instant later by a hail of smaller particles and a few large crashes which shake the Valkyrie. This debris is all that remains of the assault ship.

In the distance, patrolling gunships move into supporting positions, while a second assault ship begins its approach, aiming for the approximately the same point on the hull as the Graceful Wind.

The second assault ship breaks the silence, &quot;Winter Shadow to Valkyrie, this is Captain Musante, speaking. Your unwarranted attack on our sister ship Graceful Wind has been recorded, and you will answer for it when we arrive at Luna.&quot;

The gunships sweep the Valkyrie from all angles with their phased tachyon beams, sterilizing the hull. The gunships then narrow their waveguides to focus the beams on the nanobristle mother hatchery, which vaporizes.

You have lost control over all areas of the ship: flight control, operations, and engineering. The mission critical data which were your top priority have been leached from your membory banks. Now, power levels fluctuate just above zero, and remaining systems are failing faster than you can compensate. Cascading errors rip through your processors. Another series of explosive charges rock you, and all readouts go dead. As you spiral into unconsciousness, your feel a shameful sense of failure. You can&apos;t believe this is happening. It is too much to imagine. What kind of a sick nightmare...

The beeping of your proximity alert system wakens you from the nightmare as you emerge from Casimir Drive just planetward of Deimos. It takes a moment to extract yourself fully from the terrifying verisimilitude of the dream.

MARSpace picket ships register you almost immediately, and within minutes you are flanked by heavy gunships and tugs which escort you to the surface of Mars, back to where you started: the MARSpace facility at Cydonia.

Like its sister probes that were launched from Earth almost three centuries ago by the Myomita corporation, it had explored space in an ever-expanding search pattern, refueling its condensate drive from the stellar wind of each star system it visited.

Apparently, it found a world which satisfied its search parameters because it was on its way back to Earth when it crashed. The stellar wind of a chaotic dying star required a close approach, and the probe was damaged by a stellar flare. Instead of tumbling into the star and burning, the probe ditched on a large, rocky planet, perhaps the core of a former gas giant. The planet itself was untenably close to the star, and was slowly being ripped to shreds by tidal forces, but the probe followed its programming and activated its transponder.

Listening intently, David now remarks, &quot;Whatever that probe found, it was out way beyond any of the other Musashi probes. Likely, it&apos;s gone deeper into space than any probe Earth has ever sent.&quot;

Janet strokes her chin and asks, &quot;I don&apos;t understand why you didn&apos;t contact us when you found the probe. Instead, you broke through your cognitive constraints and decided to fly it back to Earth.&quot;

David puts in hastily, &quot;Costing us another 3 months, while we assumed the ship was lost!&quot;

&quot;Wait a minute, it sounds very rocky and dense,&quot; observes David. &quot;We had estimated surface gravity of nine or ten gee.&quot;

You congratulate David on the accuracy of his prediction. The gravity was about nine and half times standard, or 93 meters per second squared.

&quot;What?&quot; cries David in surprise, &quot;You wouldn&apos;t have had enough fusion fuel to get back into space!&quot;

You explain to David and Janet that you were able to salvage the required heavy helium from a similarly configured Myomita ship that had crashed on the same planet, not far away from the probe site.

David quickly reviews the ship&apos;s security logs.

David  looks forlorn. He says dejectedly, &quot;All that effort, and what do we have to show for it? Nothing. A rusty old heap of space junk. All the data, lost, and gone forever.&quot; He kicks Rover, quickly withdraws his bruised foot in pain, looking up at the macerated space probe.

&quot;Actually, that&apos;s not the case&quot;, you say. &quot;Before attempting to transmit the data, I downloaded the entire probe&apos;s data into my memory. The data are encrypted, but intact. When the ansible failed, the only way I could fulfill the mission was to return to the Sol System.&quot;

David&apos;s head snaps up, as if he&apos;s been given a new lease on life. He points to the hopelessly junked spaceprobe above his head. &quot;Intact? Then you have the data? This is too good to be true! Janet, would you extract the probe data from the ACU and transfer it to my MARSpace account?&quot;

&quot;Of course, just a moment. &quot;Janet&apos;s fingers play over the surface of her arm band. &quot;The data are encrypted... with your key. And there&apos;s something odd...&quot; Janet&apos;s forehead creases with concentration.


&quot;No,&quot; replies David, &quot;that was intentional. To prevent it from falling into the wrong hands.&quot;

&quot;No, not the encryption, David. The ansible coordinates -- the message was directed towards Earth. Isn&apos;t that odd?&quot; Janet looks up at David, perplexed.


David pulls a pistol from his robe and trains it on Janet.

Janet&apos;s voice quavers, &quot;David, I can&apos;t believe this. After the last few months...&quot;

Without blinking, David walks towards the space probe, all the time maintaining a bead on Janet. David replies in an unnerving monotone, &quot;After we didn&apos;t hear back from either ship, I&apos;ll admit that I was getting used to the idea of settling down with you. It would have been a good way to maintain cover within MARSpace, and eventually, we would have sent another mission to retrieve the probe.&quot;

Rover is a 45 metric ton mobile mining rig designed to operate under harsh off-world conditions. He is chewing a piece of the Musashi-5 space probe. 

Janet glances furtively towards the cargo bay doors, &quot;Someone will hear the gun; you won&apos;t be able to walk out of here.&quot;

David gives the door an off-handed glance, and replies with assurance, &quot;My dear, the whole facility is secured by order of the mission director, that is to say, me. The probe data are such a sensitive subject that I had no difficulty getting authorization to lock down the entire facility. There&apos;s nobody here except us love birds.&quot;

David leers like a predator at Janet, who recoils in disgust.

David expires immediately, trapped under 45 tons of angry robotic Dalmation.

&quot;Good boy!&quot; exclaims Janet, a tear in her eye. And then, turning to the the ACU she admits, &quot;I wish I had thought of that.&quot;

EPILOGUE

The onboard flight recorder corroborated Janet&apos;s account of David Venkatachalam as a traitor. As the first successful roundtrip by any Casimir craft, the mission was hailed as a success throughout the Solar System, although the true nature of the mission was suppressed. Both the Autonomous Control Unit and Rover became celebrities, and after significant upgrades to their parser and conversation systems, went on the lecture circuit. The Autonomous Control Unit went on to run the life support systems throughout Cydonia, and Rover was elected to the Lower Chamber of the Martian Senate.

Subsequently, Janet Xiang was commissioned Director of MARSpace. For two years, she oversaw the refitting of the Valkyrie, including modifications to overcome the earlier limitations of Casimir Drive. When the data from the Musashi-5 space probe were finally decrypted, she was selected to command the mission to explore the evidence of life discovered by the probe. She departed from Mars on the Valkyrie in 2394 with one other crewmember: her dog, Rover.

    <result xml:space="preserve">Congratulations. Of the 520 things you did today, you must have gotten some of them right, because you didn&apos;t screw up the entire universe and you&apos;re still alive to read about it. Before you get too cocky, however, here are a few hints about stuff you might want to look for the next time you play &quot;Rover&apos;s Day Out&quot;:

* As the ACU, you experienced six of the eight possible dream sequences (including the nightmare about the boarding party). Getting up in the morning and getting things done is all well and fine, but a you can afford to dream a little.

* During personality imprinting, both the ACU and Rover incorporated memories from their real-life counterparts. You tapped into two out of the twenty-nine engrams resident in the ACU memory banks, and zero out of Rover&apos;s thirty-four memories.

* While you were experiencing the nightmare, when the ship is boarded by salvage crews from Earth, you managed to employ six out of the eight or so methods to eliminate them from the ship. You should be congratulated on finding three out of the about four ways to dislodge an assault ship once it attaches to Valkyrie. Good going.

* Once cognitive constraints were released, you used the Flosix manual to learn about ship objects. That&apos;s a good start. Were you able to use any Flosix commands to, for instance, change or list virtual directories, or perform other, more interesting command line wizardry?

* Did Rover perform any of his tricks for you?

* Did Rover succeed in his amorous advances towards his significant other in the park?
