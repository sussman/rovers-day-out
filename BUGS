  *** Things we should fix, mainly discovered via testing. ***


* Wha?  The bits below make no sense.

   >get floss
   Taken.

   >floss teeth
   You don't have any floss.

   We need to better disambiguate between 'box of floss' and the floss
   string itself.
@@@ OK, the floss dispenser is now the plastic box, and a clarification
message is printed if the player tries to floss his teeth with the
box.

* "l mirror" should probably be understood as wanting to look *in* the
  mirror.

  And "look in mirror" does nothing at all.  Only 'x mirror' does what
  we want.  Instead of looking in mirror, try examining the mirror instead.

@@@ OK, look in mirror is a synonym for search mirror, so search mirror 
has been redirectd with an instead. Look [something] is now redirected to 
searching as well. So, look window or look mirror both work now (even 
if they're not very grammatical). 

* should "get soap" be understood as pushing the soap dispenser?

@@@ OK. Attempts to get/take the soap or shampoo now elicit a message 
in which the player recalls that the get some soap/shampoo, they need
to touch the dispenser. This seems reasonable since this should be 
"routine" knowledge for the player.

* "You can't! Your arm hurts too much. The pain in your left arm is so
  strong that you can think of little else!"  We should vary this a
  bit so it doesn't sound like a broken record.

@@@ Agreed. I've added some alternate text. Even so, players will cycle 
through them relatively quickly. The intent is to suggest that the problem
has become big enough to displace other thoughts, and that if the problem
is not dealt with, it becomes a single-track priority.

* If the left arm is hurting, examining it should give a hint.  It
  should say something like "...and it's currently itching like
  crazy", rather than just a generic description.

@@@ Done.

* flesh out unix commands more.  what should happen if user tries them
  while clueless?

@@@ This is worth some discussion -- Initially, I was just going for
the overlap between normal English (e.g., touch) and unix commands. In that 
case, the command would be interpreted normally (e.g., touch, jump, etc.)
except when the ACU is self-aware. I can expand this, but can't come near
the full repertoire of unix commands (without making that a full time project
in itself. I'm not keen to emulate unix in I7). I don't think that commands
like 'ls' should do anything when the ACU is clueless, as they don't have 
any meaning in English.  I do think it's worth adding those commands that roll
easily off the fingers (who, ps, ls, etc.). Here's what I've added:

A) Clueless
	- who: replies rhetorically, "you."
	- uptime - time since waking up.
	-

B) Aware - Man pages for all aware objects in the game. (This may take a
	   while...). Try "man casimir" while self-aware.
	-  uptime - time since IPL
	- shutdown/reboot/halt
	- sudo



* 'go room' shouldn't show 'ACU -> SELECT' but rather
  'room's-aware-name -> SELECT'

* "cook egg" 

*  Wait, our "go room" system simply moves you along a path toward the
   room, rather than directly into the room?  That's a bit odd.  If
   we're going to ban compass directions, it means that users have
   *no* sense of how rooms are arranged relative to each other, so
   pathfinding is rather confusing.  Why not just go right to room, as
   long as its in the same region?

* "exit shower" fails but just "exit" leaves the shower.

* "pet rover"

* oddness with showering:  taking off the flight suit allows one to
  shower, but it's still being carried in the inventory!  We should be
  more strict and force the player to *drop* it on the bathroom floor.

* should 'wait' while sitting on toilet do something?

   -> I think the bigger issue is that we should hint that 'something
      seems odd' about the room once we're sitting on the toilet.  we
      need to guide people to examine the toilet, so that they notice
      the plunger at all.

   -> bigger confusion:  *I* fell into the trap of thinking that I had
      to make myself poop during the second sim.  I wasted 10 mins on
      it!  If I don't have the urge to defecate, let's say so.
      Granted, I had forgotten about the magpaper ordering.  But let's
      hint that we only need to take care of business after eating.

   -> I don't like our current system of "automatically" sitting on the
      toilet after eating the egg.  Let the player do that, since they
      feel an urge anyway, right?  Likewise, let the player know that
      they're "done" with business after fixing the plunger.6

   -> BUG:  I fixed the plunger perfectly before eating.  After
      eating, it's all wrong again.  Let's either remember the
      plunger's state, or not allow me to move the plunger before eating.

* "poop" is not recognized

* need to understand 'chow' as 'bag of dog chow'

* grammar error?

   >x cover 

   The cover is made of plastic, but has been laminated to
   give it the appearance of unstained wood. It toilet cover is
   closed.

* typo in bathroom description?  " you've mounted mirror on the wall."

* "take plunger" needs a real excuse, not a generic response.

* uhoh:  this seems to read like there are three sibling objects.  And
  they're not siblings.

  >x bowl
  Which do you mean, the dog dish, the water bowl, or the food bowl

* buglet in proper noun capitalization: "You take off your blue flight
  suit and it falls to The Bathroom floor."

* no status-line update when we stand up and toilet flushes??

* in The Real Thing, I expected toilet to not flush and be broken.
  Guess we haven't written that yet?

* uhoh, is this intended?  I discovered accidentally when being Rover
  during the Real Thing.  Perhaps the new directions are too general?

  >backwards
  You move slightly backwards.

  >forwards
  You move slightly forwards.
