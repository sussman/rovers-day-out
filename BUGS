  *** Things we should fix, mainly discovered via testing. ***

Contained objects needs to be put in scope or otherwise worked around:
need to allow eat food/drink water to work more smoothly with the
objects that are in the dog bowls


###TOCONSIDER: responses to "wait" while on toilet seat, or hints after some period of time sitting there ... in case pooping doesn't occur to people.

* need to understand 'chow' as 'bag of dog chow'

* bug:  status-line noun shouldn't default to "ACU" all the time -- it
  should be aware of whether we're playing Janet or Rover.

* At the beginning of the game, we stand up and knock the clock behind
  the futon.  Experienced gamers will want to find it by looking
  behind/underneath the futon, and yet we move it to "Limbo"?  Why?

@@@ General laziness on my part. I didn't want players to obsess about the clock, i.e., setting the time, trying to time travel. I was also concerned that we might get into issues of continuity with regard to timing, but I don't see how that would be an issue now. Finally, I was concerned that the player might try to go back to bed or hit snooze again, although there are plenty of ways around that.

All things considered, it wouldn't take much more to implement the clock. As for it rolling under the bed, that does open a bit of a can of worms, although there is an extension that deals with stuff under beds. Is it worth the overhead of importing another extension? We'll see. 

* open drawer should kill David/Janet

* statusline should be FALSE!!!!

   >flush toilet
   There is a tinny clanking from within the toilet, but nothing happens

"g" or "again" results in NOOP on status line; should recall last action.

"Fleshing Out" section.

* more nouns to define:
    
* more verbs/actions to define (or respond to):

  -need an instead of kissing rule for first person kisses

  -a general instead of sleeping rule

General Macro Issues re: plot, puzzles, etc.

* in general, status line technoverbs are always showing TRUE, not
  catching failures when they should (i.e. when toilet doesn't flush).
  read through text for examples.   (BEN TODO!)


* general question: does inform7 allow us to decide what gets written
  to transcript?  it would be nice to have status lines in transcript,
  the way jack's original prototype transcript had it.  (BEN TODO :
  ASK ON LIST)

@@@ I would recommend that we have an "option" menu that allows toggling of status line display either at the top, or inline. That way, if someone has a very rudimentary terminal (e.g., Floyd on IFmud), they could still see the status line as it changes. In fact, the transcript would more or less resemble the original transcript. When placed inline, we could set it off typographically, e.g., [[[[STATUS LINE TEXT ]]].

--> Ben sez:  actually, I don't think the user should control this, I think the game should ask glulx whether a status-line is available or not, and then output the technoverbs to an appropriate place.  (BEN TODO)

=====================================================================

Stuff that is (hopefully) fixed/resolved gets moved here...


CONCERN: It would make more sense to model the rooms with inside
   from/outside from relationships. This would more closely follow the
   directory level paradigm suggested with the flosix commands. It
   would also make going out of the shower, or out the front door make
   more sense.

@@@ As part of the movement system revision, the ship's layout has been made hierarchical, using "inside/outside" from relationships:

operations/
operations/flight control
operations/flight control/extruder
operations/engineering



---------------------------------------

Notes from Ben's first *complete* run-through of game:



* in the Real Thing, the frying pan is still sitting on the cooking
  range.  Is this intended?  Was it supposed to be reset?


* In the Real Thing, rover basically did nothing for me.  Didn't
  follow me around, didn't notice my filling his bowls, didn't want my
  treats.  We need to make him into an interesting, colorful NPC!


* "toilet" shouldn't be in this list:

  > open toilet
  Which do you mean, the toilet, the toilet bowl, the toilet seat, or
  the toilet cover?



* is there more than one solution to fix the broken toilet, other than
  the floss?  If not, we must make sure there is.


* TODO(sussman): as rover, "x house" has weird status line: "->
  DIAGNOSTIC : TRUE".  This happens quite a bit as rover.  We clearly
  need to have a noun other than "ACU" up there!  

  ('smell' shows "ACU -> CHEMOSENSOR : TRUE".  Are we really still the
  ACU?)


* 'remember foo' seems weird that it would work properly when being
  rover, especially since many of the memories are about "you, janet".

* "eat food" fails in the cottage, but "eat canned food" works...?

* unable to guess the verb for drinking the other dog's water.  fail.

* smelly man needs more variation in his blah blah complaints.

* rover mission repeated failure:

   - figured out how to get the bone.
   - got the pillow.
   - got the extra egg.
   - ate some kibble in cottage
   - couldn't figure how to drink cottage water
   - returned to janet, gave her the egg.
   - NO MENTION of pillow or bone?!?
   - went back outside, pillow is now in inventory.
   - WTF happened to the bone?  It's not back in the cottage either.
   - restored to a save-point back into cottage
   - returned home again, no opportunity to 'drop bone' or give it to janet?

  FINALLY after multiple restore attempts, figured out I had to drop
  bone and pillow OUTSIDE the front door.  Go in, give her egg
  automatically, go out, take bone again, go in again.  Eesh.  We need
  to smooth this out to be easier.  Why can't rover return all the
  inventory to Janet at once?



* instead of 'x nameplate', try reading nameplate instead.

* bug: seeing lots of "#REF ->" in the status line while self-aware.


* "read RFID tag" should work.

* bug:  during the boarding sequence:  'enter shower' shows metaspeak
  from janet and david ("I should probably check on...")

* meta-puzzle question: love the slow loss of control while the droid
  dismembers me, but is there any point to this scene?  anything I can
  do?  scratching left arm did nothing at any point, as in the
  original transcript.  On the one hand, it's a fun fiction sequence.
  On the other hand, players hate feeling helpless and shoved through
  a linear series of uncontrollable events -- it makes the game
  passive rather than active.


* back on Cydonia: "janet, hello" should should FAIL in status line,
  not TRUE.  Also "tell janet about x" shows "JANET -> SPEECH OUTPUT :
  NIL"


* "ACU prohibited from direct interaction with humans aside from
  scanning and communications".  This implies that "scan janet" should
  allow me to eavesdrop.  Also if I can see their lips moving, then
  "read lips" should work as well.  As it stands, I eventually played
  "guess the verb" and typed "listen", and things progressed.  Gotta
  make this more flexible.


* love the 'random filler actions' to-do.  :-)

* again, the same meta-question about the debriefing at the end.  It's
  fun to watch janet and david talk, see the denoument unfold, but
  also fairly unsatisfing to just repeatedly type "tell janet about
  x".  the player has no control, it's all too linear.





------------


* is thorium rock intended as an alternate solution to some other puzzle?  has no use right now.


* Things not printing correctly in status-line during Real Thing:  ("#REF -> ...")

     - floss box
     - 


* Oops, see last bit.  Need another conditional [Rover] vs. He:

READY>open fridge
Rover pops into the engineering section to investigate the thermal shift. This behavior may indicate that Rover's fuel reserve is low.

CRYOCHAMBER -> ACCESS : TRUE

ROVER He moves rapidly past the fuel reservoir which has no radioisotope payload


* Bizarre bug:

   -> If we enter the house *only* carrying the bone, we get the usual
      explanation as to why we're self-aware.

   -> If we enter the house carrying {bone, egg, pillow}, we become
      self-aware with *no explanation* why!  ....Furthermore, the egg
      is listed as being present, but there's no mention of the bone
      or pillow.  (Rover has them, its seems, but the ACU should
      notice this when she 'looks', I think?)

* Wha?  If droid destroys rover after he attacks, how can rover
  reappear (still chewing the probe) when back on Mars?  We need a
  real explanation here.

* 'su' prompts for password: 'RedMonkey737' should work.  :-) Perhaps
  an alterate way to override ACU failsafe controls?  It would be a
  different way of defeating David, beyond having rover attack.
