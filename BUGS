  *** Things we should fix, mainly discovered via testing. ***

Contained objects needs to be put in scope or otherwise worked around:
need to allow eat food/drink water to work more smoothly with the
objects that are in the dog bowls

* 'go room' shouldn't show 'ACU -> SELECT' but rather
  'room's-aware-name -> SELECT'

###TOCONSIDER: responses to "wait" while on toilet seat, or hints after some period of time sitting there ... in case pooping doesn't occur to people.

* need to understand 'chow' as 'bag of dog chow'

* bug:  status-line noun shouldn't default to "ACU" all the time -- it
  should be aware of whether we're playing Janet or Rover.

* At the beginning of the game, we stand up and knock the clock behind
  the futon.  Experienced gamers will want to find it by looking
  behind/underneath the futon, and yet we move it to "Limbo"?  Why?

@@@ General laziness on my part. I didn't want players to obsess about the clock, i.e., setting the time, trying to time travel. I was also concerned that we might get into issues of continuity with regard to timing, but I don't see how that would be an issue now. Finally, I was concerned that the player might try to go back to bed or hit snooze again, although there are plenty of ways around that.

All things considered, it wouldn't take much more to implement the clock. As for it rolling under the bed, that does open a bit of a can of worms, although there is an extension that deals with stuff under beds. Is it worth the overhead of importing another extension? We'll see. 

* open drawer should kill David/Janet

* statusline should be FALSE!!!!

   >flush toilet
   There is a tinny clanking from within the toilet, but nothing happens

"g" or "again" results in NOOP on status line; should recall last action.


--------------------------------------------------------------------
"Fleshing Out" section.

* more nouns to define:
    
* more verbs/actions to define (or respond to):

  -need an instead of kissing rule for first person kisses

  -a general instead of sleeping rule

----------------------------

General Macro Issues re: plot, puzzles, etc.


* rover doesn't seem to follow me around, or request things like food,
  etc.  it would be a much richer experience if he reacted to my
  routine or even hinted ath things when players got stuck!

@@@ This will be my main focus as general mechanisms get nailed down (JACK TODO!)

* in general, status line technoverbs are always showing TRUE, not
  catching failures when they should (i.e. when toilet doesn't flush).
  read through text for examples.   (BEN TODO!)


* general question: does inform7 allow us to decide what gets written
  to transcript?  it would be nice to have status lines in transcript,
  the way jack's original prototype transcript had it.  (BEN TODO :
  ASK ON LIST)

@@@ I would recommend that we have an "option" menu that allows toggling of status line display either at the top, or inline. That way, if someone has a very rudimentary terminal (e.g., Floyd on IFmud), they could still see the status line as it changes. In fact, the transcript would more or less resemble the original transcript. When placed inline, we could set it off typographically, e.g., [[[[STATUS LINE TEXT ]]].

=====================================================================

Stuff that is (hopefully) fixed/resolved gets moved here...


CONCERN: It would make more sense to model the rooms with inside
   from/outside from relationships. This would more closely follow the
   directory level paradigm suggested with the flosix commands. It
   would also make going out of the shower, or out the front door make
   more sense.

@@@ As part of the movement system revision, the ship's layout has been made hierarchical, using "inside/outside" from relationships:

operations/
operations/flight control
operations/flight control/extruder
operations/engineering



---------------------------------------

Notes from Ben's first *complete* run-through of game:



* Whoops:

  > x nameplate
  A brass nameplate with engraved black lettering...

  > read lettering
  There are only three letters:  "ACU".


* change "strangle hold" to "stranglehold"

* TODO(sussman):  windex crash should have blue background.

* in 'help' menu, one of the options should suggest 'remember' as a
  way to get more backstory.


* Whoops:

  > david, hello
  You can't talk to David-proxy.


* add period to end of sentence: "...embroidered in white on a red
  background".


* TODO: create logo for game.  Either red embroidered "ACU", or
  MARSpace insignia.


* things to fill out with non-generic responses:

   "taste nuggets"
   "taste treat"


* still extra spacing problems on plunger: "the handle of the plunger
  is tilted completely  backwards"; "leaning strongly  to the right"


* TODO(sussman): fix indentation of metaspeak, so that words wrap
  *beyond* Janet and David's names.  easier to read.


* In 2nd simulation, rover goes out the door without my ever filling
  his bowls.  Is this intended?

* in the Real Thing, the frying pan is still sitting on the cooking
  range.  Is this intended?  Was it supposed to be reset?


* In the Real Thing, rover basically did nothing for me.  Didn't
  follow me around, didn't notice my filling his bowls, didn't want my
  treats.  We need to make him into an interesting, colorful NPC!


* "toilet" shouldn't be in this list:

  > open toilet
  Which do you mean, the toilet, the toilet bowl, the toilet seat, or
  the toilet cover?



* is there more than one solution to fix the broken toilet, other than
  the floss?  If not, we must make sure there is.


* TODO(sussman): as rover, "x house" has weird status line: "->
  DIAGNOSTIC : TRUE".  This happens quite a bit as rover.  We clearly
  need to have a noun other than "ACU" up there!  

  ('smell' shows "ACU -> CHEMOSENSOR : TRUE".  Are we really still the
  ACU?)


* 'remember foo' seems weird that it would work properly when being
  rover, especially since many of the memories are about "you, janet".


* typo: extra period in "it is the biggest, juiciest bone you've ever
  seen".

* typo:  'sleeping room' needs capitalization?

* "eat food" fails in the cottage, but "eat canned food" works...?

* unable to guess the verb for drinking the other dog's water.  fail.

* screaming man needs more variation in his blah blah complaints.

* rover mission repeated failure:

   - figured out how to get the bone.
   - got the pillow.
   - got the extra egg.
   - ate some kibble in cottage
   - couldn't figure how to drink cottage water
   - returned to janet, gave her the egg.
   - NO MENTION of pillow or bone?!?
   - went back outside, pillow is now in inventory.
   - WTF happened to the bone?  It's not back in the cottage either.
   - restored to a save-point back into cottage
   - returned home again, no opportunity to 'drop bone' or give it to janet?

  FINALLY after multiple restore attempts, figured out I had to drop
  bone and pillow OUTSIDE the front door.  Go in, give her egg
  automatically, go out, take bone again, go in again.  Eesh.  We need
  to smooth this out to be easier.  Why can't rover return all the
  inventory to Janet at once?



* typo: missing "of" in  "immense gravity its star".

* awkward run-on grammar: rewrite the whole sentence "You wonder what
  would happen if the Valkyrie mission failed because..."

* while self-aware:  "x doors" fails, but "x door" works.

* typo:  the massive titanium cargo bay door(S) are heremetically
  sealed..."  needs S.


* instead of 'x nameplate', try reading nameplate instead.

* bug: seeing lots of "#REF ->" in the status line while self-aware.

* typo:  "thing to seriously" should be "too seriously"

* "read RFID tag" should work.

* typo:  "signal 'yes' is that is your intention" should be "if"

* bug:  during the boarding sequence:  'enter shower' shows metaspeak
  from janet and david ("I should probably check on...")

* general spelling issue:  the phrase "casimir drive" is
  inconsistently capitalized or un-capitalized throughout the whole
  source code.  Choose one, and stick to it.


* meta-puzzle question: love the slow loss of control while the droid
  dismembers me, but is there any point to this scene?  anything I can
  do?  scratching left arm did nothing at any point, as in the
  original transcript.  On the one hand, it's a fun fiction sequence.
  On the other hand, players hate feeling helpless and shoved through
  a linear series of uncontrollable events -- it makes the game
  passive rather than active.


* back on Cydonia: "janet, hello" should should FAIL in status line,
  not TRUE.  Also "tell janet about x" shows "JANET -> SPEECH OUTPUT :
  NIL"


* "ACU prohibited from direct interaction with humans aside from
  scanning and communications".  This implies that "scan janet" should
  allow me to eavesdrop.  Also if I can see their lips moving, then
  "read lips" should work as well.  As it stands, I eventually played
  "guess the verb" and typed "listen", and things progressed.  Gotta
  make this more flexible.


* typo:  "great, replies janet" is missing initial double quote.

* love the 'random filler actions' to-do.  :-)

* again, the same meta-question about the debriefing at the end.  It's
  fun to watch janet and david talk, see the denoument unfold, but
  also fairly unsatisfing to just repeatedly type "tell janet about
  x".  the player has no control, it's all too linear.

* typo: need quotation to start "dammit, janet". need closing quote
  too.

* need to polish the epilogue.  put a colon before the final word
  'rover' instead of comma.
