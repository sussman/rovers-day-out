  *** Things we should fix, mainly discovered via testing. ***

Contained objects needs to be put in scope or otherwise worked around:
need to allow eat food/drink water to work more smoothly with the
objects that are in the dog bowls

* 'go room' shouldn't show 'ACU -> SELECT' but rather
  'room's-aware-name -> SELECT'

###TOCONSIDER: responses to "wait" while on toilet seat, or hints after some period of time sitting there ... in case pooping doesn't occur to people.

* need to understand 'chow' as 'bag of dog chow'

* bug:  status-line noun shouldn't default to "ACU" all the time -- it
  should be aware of whether we're playing Janet or Rover.

* At the beginning of the game, we stand up and knock the clock behind
  the futon.  Experienced gamers will want to find it by looking
  behind/underneath the futon, and yet we move it to "Limbo"?  Why?

@@@ General laziness on my part. I didn't want players to obsess about the clock, i.e., setting the time, trying to time travel. I was also concerned that we might get into issues of continuity with regard to timing, but I don't see how that would be an issue now. Finally, I was concerned that the player might try to go back to bed or hit snooze again, although there are plenty of ways around that.

All things considered, it wouldn't take much more to implement the clock. As for it rolling under the bed, that does open a bit of a can of worms, although there is an extension that deals with stuff under beds. Is it worth the overhead of importing another extension? We'll see. 

* open drawer should kill David/Janet

* "x fridge" should say something about state of door being open/closed.

* statusline should be FALSE!!!!

   >flush toilet
   There is a tinny clanking from within the toilet, but nothing happens

"g" or "again" results in NOOP on status line; should recall last action.


--------------------------------------------------------------------
"Fleshing Out" section.

* more nouns to define:
    
* more verbs/actions to define (or respond to):

putting chow in dish -- see my transcript, very 'guess the verb'
@@@ I've tried to rework this a bit; may need more testing to see if is comes across as improved.

----------------------------

General Macro Issues re: plot, puzzles, etc.


* initial dream sequence:  how hard is it to discover the snooze
  button and be rewarded with more dreams?  unclear.

@@@ I've tried to make it easy -- if you try to do anything with the clock besides looking at it, you fumble around in your half-dream state and accidentally hit snooze. Lying down or sleeping also will lead to more dreams.

* rover doesn't seem to follow me around, or request things like food,
  etc.  it would be a much richer experience if he reacted to my
  routine or even hinted ath things when players got stuck!

@@@ This will be my main focus as general mechanisms get nailed down (JACK TODO!)

* in general, status line technoverbs are always showing TRUE, not
  catching failures when they should (i.e. when toilet doesn't flush).
  read through text for examples.   (BEN TODO!)


* general question: does inform7 allow us to decide what gets written
  to transcript?  it would be nice to have status lines in transcript,
  the way jack's original prototype transcript had it.  (BEN TODO :
  ASK ON LIST)

@@@ I would recommend that we have an "option" menu that allows toggling of status line display either at the top, or inline. That way, if someone has a very rudimentary terminal (e.g., Floyd on IFmud), they could still see the status line as it changes. In fact, the transcript would more or less resemble the original transcript. When placed inline, we could set it off typographically, e.g., [[[[STATUS LINE TEXT ]]].

=====================================================================

Stuff that is (hopefully) fixed/resolved gets moved here...

BUG: Movement system needs some revision: in from/out from for ship rooms,
and direct movement rather than direction movement -- will simplify a
lot of issues. Also revise the checks on moving from room to room and
make sure that all entry-triggered actions still work. Known issue:
when janet takes the egg from livingroom to kitchen, it jumps to the
fridge in Real Thing.

@@@ revised and simplified the going to / exiting mechanism. Checked all entry-triggered events; they seem to be OK. The egg no longer jumps around magically.

CONCERN: It would make more sense to model the rooms with inside
   from/outside from relationships. This would more closely follow the
   directory level paradigm suggested with the flosix commands. It
   would also make going out of the shower, or out the front door make
   more sense.

@@@ As part of the movement system revision, the ship's layout has been made hierarchical, using "inside/outside" from relationships:

operations/
operations/flight control
operations/flight control/extruder
operations/engineering

BUG: * "exit shower" fails but just "exit" leaves the shower.

@@@ Exit [location] now works properly in a generalized sense.

BUGLET: Consider simplifying Rover's food/drink bowl in Valkyrie.
 
@@@ Instead of a conjoined monstrosity of an uberfeeding bowl, the food bowl and the water bowl are implemented as individual items. This should make life more pleasant.

CONCERN: General concerns about 'remember':  how is a user going to know to
  remember something?  We need an event to set off a flood of
  'remember' actions -- like a textbook, perhaps?

   The player really *needs* the backstory of politics, the valkyrie's
   mission, and the competition from earth.  Otherwise the whole Real
   Thing section (and especially rover's solution to liftoff) won't
   make any sense to the player.... nor will the solution be something
   that occurs naturally to the player.

   Specifically, these topics *must* be read before Real Thing:

      - probe
      - myomita
      - war
      - valkyrie
      - casimir

@@@ These picture / nameplate in the living room now serve this purpose. The nameplate triggers a memory of the photo, which covers these five items and introduces the mechanism of remembering. The same information is provided in interstitial comments by David/Janet during first and second sim, and is incorporated into dialogue in Boarding Party and Back on Mars.

CONCERN: I think the bigger issue is that we should hint that 'something
      seems odd' about the room once we're sitting on the toilet.  we
      need to guide people to examine the toilet, so that they notice
      the plunger at all.

@@@ Before flushing, the player is distracting by something not being right. If this isn't strong enough, we can add more.

CONCERN: bigger confusion:  *I* fell into the trap of thinking that I had
      to make myself poop during the second sim.  I wasted 10 mins on
      it!  If I don't have the urge to defecate, let's say so.
      Granted, I had forgotten about the magpaper ordering.  But let's
      hint that we only need to take care of business after eating.

@@@ You now need to do *something* while sitting there.  The "EcoSensor" on the toilet won't let you flush it unless there is a reason. A wide variety of action verbs is accomodated, including some that would ordinarily trigger the "block swearing obscenely" rule. 

CONCERN -> I don't like our current system of "automatically" sitting on the
      toilet after eating the egg.  Let the player do that, since they
      feel an urge anyway, right?  Likewise, let the player know that
      they're "done" with business after fixing the plunger.

@@@ Agree; this felt like railroading, so the player is now free to sit/stand/poop/flush without being tossed about like a puppet.

BUG:  I fixed the plunger perfectly before eating.  After
      eating, it's all wrong again.  Let's either remember the
      plunger's state, or not allow me to move the plunger before eating.

@@@ This was intentional, but I've made it work the way you expected. My initial thought was that the attitude corrections should be made right before landing, so the yoke would randomize when the landing sequence begins (i.e., after eating). The yoke also randomizes at the beginning of each major segment (first sim, second, real thing), though. I finally decided that randomizing before each segment was sufficient. This is consistent with allowing players more freedom in the order of their operations. Somewhere in the game it mentions that the perception of time is not very relevant, as the ACU works so quickly.

BUG  * no status-line update when we stand up and toilet flushes??

@@@ Now gives RETROS -> THRUST: TRUE

BUG: * grammar error?

   >x cover 

   The cover is made of plastic, but has been laminated to
   give it t

@@@ Fixed.

BUG uhoh:  this seems to read like there are three sibling objects.  And
  they're not siblings.

  >x bowl
  Which do you mean, the dog dish, the water bowl, or the food bowl

@@@ In fixing the dog bowl design in the kitchen, the water and food bowls are separate, there is no more dog dish.  "x bowl" should prompt, "do you mean water or food bowl", though, as "bowl" itself is ambiguous.

BUG: in The Real Thing, I expected toilet to not flush and be broken.
  Guess we haven't written that yet?

@@@ It's now written.

BUG: * uhoh, I've never even *heard* of a silver knob yet.

  >twist handle counterclockwise
  Which do you mean, the silver knob, or the shaft?

@@@ Now mentioned in the water tank description and some text related to fixing the broken chain.

BUG: * oops:
    
  >look inside tank
  In the water tank is an inside of the tank

   "look inside tank" - lots of problems trying to see inside tank.

@@@ I overhauled the interior of the toilet's water tank. The inner workings should now all be visible.

* typo:  "tinyist" --> "tiniest" in plunger puzzle.

@@@ Fixed

* "businessing" isn't in technoverb table.

@@@ It is now!

BUG * oops!  in the bathroom:

  >x box
  Which do you mean, the plastic box, or the plastic box-proxy?

@@@ Disambiguated. It's a box when the player is clueless, but it's a cylinder when the ACU is self-aware. 

BUG: * "pet rover" 

@@@ Implemented.

BUG: * also:
  >rover, hello
  (Note:  answering it that isn't in technoverb-table)

@@@ Implemented.

BUG:-suppress "to do list heavy handed...?" after second sim.

@@@ Should only fire off during the first or second sim

BUGLET: - brush teeth should implicitly get the brush

@@@ Implemented.

FEATURE - a before taking off the flight suit rule to prevent disrobe while on a supporter or other weird locations

@@@ Implemented.

BUG: - Janet should be dressed when Rover comes back from walkies, otherwise it seems odd for her glance to fall on her flight suit.

@@@ Fixed.

BUG: * "look out window" should work.  try 'look outside' instead?

@@@ Look out / look out window / look outside / look through window - all work now.

BUGLET: - examine self should mention if player is sitting/laying on bed, counter, toilet, etc.

@@@ Added as an after examine rule

CONCERN: - suppress the room description or use a Rover's POV description of the living room when he first enters?

@@@ Implemented

FEATURE: * "cook egg" 

@@@ Implemented

CONCERN: Fleshing out
* sunlight (mentioned in skylight description)
* remember condensate (drive) (since we remember casimir)
* remember earth

@@@ Added. Plus a few more.

CONCERN: Fleshing out
* wash hands in sink

@@@ Changed the description of the sink to not mention washing hands. If Washing is an action, it creates all kinds of issues with use of the shower. Although it would be reasonable for someone who is clueless to assume that you could wash hands in either the sink or the shower (or wash other things), the sink and shower serve different purposes in the aware-context. I couldn't make the parallelism work with a "washing" verb.

CONCERN: Fleshing out
    sing, jump ("sometimes the ACU sings and jumps" -- we need
    non-default responses.)

@@@ Doh. Jump, dance, and sing are now implemented.

BUGLET: * plunger is "twisted  clockwise" (extra space).  happens in several places in the dynamic description of plunger position.

@@@ Superfluous space expurgated.
