  *** Things we should fix, mainly discovered via testing. ***


Movement system needs some revision: in from/out from for ship rooms,
and direct movement rather than direction movement -- will simplify a
lot of issues. Also revise the checks on moving from room to room and
make sure that all entry-triggered actions still work. Known issue:
when janet takes the egg from livingroom to kitchen, it jumps to the
fridge in Real Thing.

Contained objects needs to be put in scope or otherwise worked around:
need to allow eat food/drink water to work more smoothly with the
objects that are in the dog bowls

-suppress "to do list heavy handed...?" after second sim.
- examine self should mention if player is sitting/laying on bed, counter, toilet, etc.
- brush teeth should implicitly get the brush
- disambiguate box from box-proxy
- suppress the room description or use a Rover's POV description of the living room when he first enters?

- Janet should be dressed when Rover comes back from walkies, otherwise it seems odd for her glance to fall on her flight suit.


Consider simplifying Rover's food/drink bowl in Valkyrie.

* General concerns about 'remember':  how is a user going to know to
  remember something?  We need an event to set off a flood of
  'remember' actions -- like a textbook, perhaps?

   The player really *needs* the backstory of politics, the valkyrie's
   mission, and the competition from earth.  Otherwise the whole Real
   Thing section (and especially rover's solution to liftoff) won't
   make any sense to the player.... nor will the solution be something
   that occurs naturally to the player.

   Specifically, these topics *must* be read before Real Thing:

      - probe
      - myomita
      - war
      - valkyrie
      - casimir



* 'go room' shouldn't show 'ACU -> SELECT' but rather
  'room's-aware-name -> SELECT'

### TODO status line when going towards

* "cook egg" 

### TODO cook egg


###TOCONSIDER: It would make more sense to model the rooms with inside
   from/outside from relationships. This would more closely follow the
   directory level paradigm suggested with the flosix commands. It
   would also make going out of the shower, or out the front door make
   more sense.


* "exit shower" fails but just "exit" leaves the shower.

###TODO exit shower

* "pet rover"

###TODO pet rover


* should 'wait' while sitting on toilet do something?

   -> I think the bigger issue is that we should hint that 'something
      seems odd' about the room once we're sitting on the toilet.  we
      need to guide people to examine the toilet, so that they notice
      the plunger at all.

   -> bigger confusion:  *I* fell into the trap of thinking that I had
      to make myself poop during the second sim.  I wasted 10 mins on
      it!  If I don't have the urge to defecate, let's say so.
      Granted, I had forgotten about the magpaper ordering.  But let's
      hint that we only need to take care of business after eating.

   -> I don't like our current system of "automatically" sitting on the
      toilet after eating the egg.  Let the player do that, since they
      feel an urge anyway, right?  Likewise, let the player know that
      they're "done" with business after fixing the plunger.6

   -> BUG:  I fixed the plunger perfectly before eating.  After
      eating, it's all wrong again.  Let's either remember the
      plunger's state, or not allow me to move the plunger before eating.

###TODO better implementation of taking care of business @@@ In
writing the "taking care of business" section, I was trying to avoid
giving the impression that the game was written by a 13-year old
focused on potty humor. On the other hand, if one is presented with a
toilet, it does seem natural... I'll need to come back to this
section. I don't want it to come across as puerile or overly graphic.

* "poop" is not recognized

###TODO: poop/shit/defecate .... "Even real adventurers have to go sometime."

* need to understand 'chow' as 'bag of dog chow'

* grammar error?

   >x cover 

   The cover is made of plastic, but has been laminated to
   give it the appearance of unstained wood. It toilet cover is
   closed.


* uhoh:  this seems to read like there are three sibling objects.  And
  they're not siblings.

  >x bowl
  Which do you mean, the dog dish, the water bowl, or the food bowl

###TODO: disambiguate dog bowl objects in kitchen


* no status-line update when we stand up and toilet flushes??

###TODO: update status after flush

* in The Real Thing, I expected toilet to not flush and be broken.
  Guess we haven't written that yet?

###TODO: broken toilet puzzle in real thing


* bug:  status-line noun shouldn't default to "ACU" all the time -- it
  should be aware of whether we're playing Janet or Rover.


* At the beginning of the game, we stand up and knock the clock behind
  the futon.  Experienced gamers will want to find it by looking
  behind/underneath the futon, and yet we move it to "Limbo"?  Why?

* "look out window" should work.  try 'look outside' instead?

* oops!  in the bathroom:

  >x box
  Which do you mean, the plastic box, or the plastic box-proxy?


* open drawer should kill David/Janet

* "x fridge" should say something about state of door being open/closed.

* plunger is "twisted  clockwise" (extra space).  happens in several
  places in the dynamic description of plunger position.

* uhoh, I've never even *heard* of a silver knob yet.

  >twist handle counterclockwise
  Which do you mean, the silver knob, or the shaft?

* typo:  "tinyist" --> "tiniest" in plunger puzzle.

* "businessing" isn't in technoverb table.

* also:
  
  >rover, hello
  (Note:  answering it that isn't in technoverb-table

* statusline should be FALSE!!!!

   >flush toilet
   There is a tinny clanking from within the toilet, but nothing happens


* oops:

  >look inside tank
  In the water tank is an inside of the tank


--------------------------------------------------------------------
"Fleshing Out" section.

Nothing reeks of newbie-game-writer-ness than missing nouns and
verbs.  If we describe things floridly, we need to be ready to respond
to every verb and noun we conjure up in our descriptions.  When
obvious commands fail, players get annoyed.


* more nouns to define:

    sunlight (mentioned in skylight description)

    remember condensate (drive) (since we remember casimir)

    remember earth

    
* more verbs/actions to define (or respond to):

    wash hands  (sink description is "enough room to wash your hands")

    sing, jump ("sometimes the ACU sings and jumps" -- we need
    non-default responses.)

    putting chow in dish -- see my transcript, very 'guess the verb'

    "look inside tank" - lots of problems trying to see inside tank.

----------------------------

General Macro Issues re: plot, puzzles, etc.


* initial dream sequence:  how hard is it to discover the snooze
  button and be rewarded with more dreams?  unclear.


* rover doesn't seem to follow me around, or request things like food,
  etc.  it would be a much richer experience if he reacted to my
  routine or even hinted ath things when players got stuck!


* in general, status line technoverbs are always showing TRUE, not
  catching failures when they should (i.e. when toilet doesn't flush).
  read through text for examples.   (BEN TODO!)


* general question: does inform7 allow us to decide what gets written
  to transcript?  it would be nice to have status lines in transcript,
  the way jack's original prototype transcript had it.  (BEN TODO :
  ASK ON LIST)
