  *** Things we should fix, mainly discovered via testing. ***


* Wha?  The bits below make no sense.

   >get floss
   Taken.

   >floss teeth
   You don't have any floss.


* "l mirror" should probably be understood as wanting to look *in* the
  mirror.

* should "get soap" be understood as pushing the soap dispenser?

* "You can't! Your arm hurts too much. The pain in your left arm is so
  strong that you can think of little else!"  We should vary this a
  bit so it doesn't sound like a broken record.

* If the left arm is hurting, examining it should give a hint.  It
  should say something like "...and it's currently itching like
  crazy", rather than just a generic description.

* flesh out unix commands more.  what should happen if user tries them
  while clueless?
