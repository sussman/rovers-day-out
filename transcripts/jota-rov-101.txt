Rover draws pensively on his stubby cigar, the tip glowing red below his dealer's hat. He paws nonchalantly at the scotch and water he has been nursing for the last half hour. Despite the tower of chips in front of him, he's either in trouble now, or trying to play the rest of the table for suckers. His tail is no longer wagging, though, and you suspect that the scotch may be getting the better of him. He can't mass more than about 30 kilos, and he's been putting them away tonight. You push all in, figuring that even if you lose it all, at least you'll get some sleep before you need to get back to the MARSpace. Elva the cleaning lady folds, as does Isaac Asimov and that boy that you kissed in fourth grade. Wait...don't go....where is everyone going?

Rover's Day Out
An Interactive Simulation by Janet Xiang
Release beta 732 / Serial number 23920401 / Inform 10.6 build Mu-013 (I6/v.7.1 lib 7/18N)

Rover draws pensively on his stubby cigar, the tip glowing red below his dealer's hat. He paws nonchalantly at the scotch and water he has been nursing for the last half hour. Despite the tower of chips in front of him, he's either in trouble now, or trying to play the rest of the table for suckers. His tail is no longer wagging, though, and you suspect that the scotch may be getting the better of him. He can't mass more than about 30 kilos, and he's been putting them away tonight. You push all in, figuring that even if you lose it all, at least you'll get some sleep before you need to get back to the MARSpace. Elva the cleaning lady folds, as does Isaac Asimov and that boy that you kissed in fourth grade. Wait...don't go....where is everyone going?



David: You have some weird dreams.
Janet: You can't hold me responsible for the subconscious
       ramblings of the ACU.

<beep> <beep> <beep>

>x rover
Darkness is great for sleeping, not so good for looking at stuff.

<beep> <beep> <beep>

>i
You are carrying nothing, which is more often than not the case when you wake up most days.

<beep> <beep> <beep>

Alarm clock. Next to bed. Make it stop.

<beep> <beep> <beep>

>x clock
Alarm clock. That annoying alarm clock. The alarm clock is beeping.

<beep> <beep> <beep>

>x bed
Your futon is huge, and oh so comfy. The wooden frame supports a king-size mattress that is pulled out to form a bed. An alarm clock is balanced precariously near the edge of the futon.

<beep> <beep> <beep>

>get clock
You poke the clock smartly in the middle of the snooze button.

The alarm clock rolls into a ball, and flies the length of the vehicle construction facility, chased by an eager, slobbering dalmation. In the Martian gravity, Rover bounds 3 meters into the air and sails over the heads of an annoyed crew in cleanroom suits working frantically on the main fusion rocket heavy-helium regulator. The mission director, David Venkatachalam, grimaces, but your mother offers you a comforting cup of tea.



David: The ACU certainly has that dog on its mind.
Janet: Well, I do think about Rover a lot. Besides, the ROVER
       is central to the mission, so a lot of the code is
       dedicated to the ROVER.
David: I don't really make that expression do I? I looked
       pouty.
Janet: All the time, but I like the word "petulant" better
       than "pouty".
David: I'll stick with pouty.

<beep> <beep> <beep>

>wake up
Gathering your resolve, you slowly slide off the side of the futon, inadvertently sending the alarm clock on a death spiral off the edge of the futon. Oh well, you can find it later. Meanwhile, you slowly stand up, recapitulating millions of years of evolution in a few seconds.



David: Thank you. I can only take so many dream sequences.
Janet: No problem. So, at this point, the Valkyrie would
       be at the edge of the probe's stellar system, and
       ready to switch over from Casimir to condensate drive
       and begin the approach.

As you get out of bed, you notice that your left arm tickles a bit -- must have been the way you were sleeping.

>x arm
Which do you mean, the left arm, or the right arm?

>left
A sliver of sunlight only goes so far; you can't see that well in the dim light.

>touch it
You touch your arm, but that doesn't stop the itching.

>scratch it
Ooooo. Ahhhh...slowly, the itchiness subsides. That feels so good.



David: Is the static charge neutralization part of the script?
Janet: No, that's the point of the ACU -- it isn't a set
       script. As we throw malfunctions at it in these simulations,
       the ACU responds appropriately. We can't, for instance,
       know that Valkyrie will accumulate a static charge
       in a particular area, so the ACU has to be flexible
       enough to react to unpredictable events.
David: Like you would.
Janet: Subject to the resolution of the synaptic scan, yes.

>look
Living Room
Where the heavy drapes meet, a sliver of sunlight shines into the otherwise dark living room. A framed picture hangs on the living room wall in the small area illuminated by the shaft of light.

>x drapes
The heavy brown drapes are closed. The room is dark.

>open it
That's not something you can open.

>open them
You push aside the drapes.

Living Room
You are in the living room of a small cottage. Piped-in sunlight pours in through the room's single window, illuminating a framed picture on the opposite wall. The principal furnishing is a king-size purple futon which takes up almost all the floor space. From the living room you can see the entrance to the kitchen and bathroom. The cottage's front door is closed.

You can see an alarm clock and Rover here.



David: I see it successfully accessed the solar shield.
Janet: Yes, the status line makes it clear what work is being
       performed.

>x sunlight
Bright daylight shines in through the window facing the park. The light is ever so slightly tinted red from surface reflection near the collectors.

Rover bounds up onto the futon and begins to get comfortable, rolling his muzzle back and forth on the mattress. Abruptly, his head pokes up and he realizes that you are watching him. Recognizing the awkwardness of being caught on the forbidden futon, Rover slinks down behind it and slowly emerges. He looks over his own shoulder at the futon as if to say "I wonder who that dog was on the futon?".

>x window
The window is triple-paned pressure glass, mounted flush with the wall.  Through the window you can see an array of skylights, a park, some grass, and some trees.

>x picture
A picture of the Starship Valkyrie, still under construction in drydock. There is small brass nameplate below the picture.

Rover 's ears perk up, as if he hears something.

>x futon
Your futon is huge, and oh so comfy. The wooden frame supports a king-size mattress that is pulled out to form a bed.

>x floor
A hardwood floor.

>x surface
You can't see any such thing.


David: How can it be aware of that?
Janet: It can't. That's outside the simulation. I sometimes
       mumble to myself about whatever is on my mind from
       work. That must have carried over during the scan.
David: Hmph.

>x reflection
You can't see any such thing.

>x collectors
You can't see any such thing.

>x entrance
You can't see any such thing.

>x kitchen
You can see the corner of the kitchen cabinet, which is closed. You can also see one of Rover's bowls from here, but at this distance, you can't tell which one.

>x bathroom
From here, you can see just a corner of the bathroom: a bit of the marble counter, and the corner of the sink.

>x door
The front door of the cottage is closed.

>x clock
It's a cheap, white plastic alarm clock with fading green LEDs that read 5:50 am.  A large button juts out of the top.



David: Why is it so interested in the clock?
Janet: Not sure.

>x skylights
Early morning sunlight piped from the surface of the planet shines brightly on the well-manicured lawn of the park.

>x park
Lincoln Park is the largest park dome in Cydonia. Later today, you'd expect it to be full of people playing frisbee, picnicking, and otherwise enjoying the great outdoors.

>x grass
A closely trimmed sea of luscious orange grass.

>x trees
A line of tall, dark green trees stands at the far edge of the park.

>x nameplate
A brass nameplate bearing a short inscription. The nameplate is attached to the bottom of the picture.

>x cabinet
You can see the corner of the kitchen cabinet, which is closed. You can also see one of Rover's bowls from here, but at this distance, you can't tell which one.

>x bowl
You can see the corner of the kitchen cabinet, which is closed. You can also see one of Rover's bowls from here, but at this distance, you can't tell which one.

>x counter
You can't see any such thing.

>x sink
From here, you can see just a corner of the bathroom: a bit of the marble counter, and the corner of the sink.

>get clock
You pick up your beat-up old alarm clock and put it back on the futon, so you can enjoy its lovely beeping tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow.

Rover seems relaxed.

>x button
Mounted almost flush with the top of the clock, you can barely make out the dimly illuminated word "snoo".



David: You could use a new alarm clock.
Janet: You could increase my salary.

>x cydonia
You can't see any such thing.

>open window
The windows are triple-paned both as a matter of thermal efficiency and some insurance against catastrophic decompression of the dome, however unlikely that might be these days.

>read nameplate
It says, "Good luck at MARSpace! - Tomasz"

Tomasz's valediction makes you remember happier times...

Your late fiancé gave you the photo when you began working on the Valkyrie Project as a graduate student -- a happier time before the Independence War with Earth, and the attacks on Mars by Earth's Myomita Corporation. Back then, Valkyrie's experimental Casimir Drive was an exciting technological adventure, rather than a military priority. Now the Valkyrie is Mars' only chance to recover data from a recently discovered space probe marooned in deep space. For whatever reason, MARSpace feels that probe could hold information that could finally give Mars the upper hand in its competition with Earth.



David: Why did we lose audio?
Janet: I've muted the ACU's memories -- they are, after all,
       a bit personal.   We don't need to hear them, but
       they may be useful for the ACU to come up to speed.
David: That's fine.  How much can the ACU remember, though?
Janet: It's based on my own synaptic scan, so it can willfully
       remember a wide variety of subjects -- almost any
       major component of my life, important events, and
       so on.  It adds depth to its decisions.
David: If you say so.  I'd hate to know what it remembers
       about me.
Janet: I wouldn't worry too much.



[Note: You can recall something from your past by typing "REMEMBER something", e.g. "REMEMBER casimir drive"]

>set clock
Please be more specific.

>set clock to 6:00
No, you can't set that to anything.

>remember casimir drive
The Casimir, or zero-point energy drive, was developed in the last ten years. By doing largely incomprehensible things to time/space, the Casimir Drive can translate a ship incredible distances in a fraction of the time and energy that would be required by a ship equipped with condensate drive.

The one drawback to Casimir technology, at least in its current implementation, is that such trips are lethal to biological organisms, hence the need for the ACU. Human test subjects exposed even briefly to Casimir gradients experienced intense dreams and nightmares; those with longer exposures died during a state of heavy REM activity. Even the ACU is not immune to the quantum distortions responsible for this effect and is expected to experience dream states while in hibernation mode during Casimir jumps.



David: I think I'd like to have heard that one.
Janet: Not a chance.

>remember acu
Your project for the last two years has been design of the autonomous control unit, an artificially intelligent agent that controls all operations aboard the Valkyrie. Originally, the ACU would have been modeled on synaptic scans of experts from relevant fields of study, but given the short time frame, you have only had time to incorporate your own synaptic scans and you have jury-rigged the ACU-to-ship interface.



David: I'm half tempted to decompile the code just to see
       what it said.
Janet: My code is not for the faint of heart. If you wander
       in there, watch out for grues.
David: Grooze?

>remember david
David Venkatachalam, age 42, citizen of Mars, and Project Leader for the Valkyrie program. David was raised in an undersea community just north of Sri Lanka, so he had less difficulty adapting to Mars and its life support requirements than most Earthers. He studied mathematics in New Delhi and Novosibirsk before working on theoretical aspects of the Casimir propulsion system at Myomita Corporation in Sapporo. He was cut off from Earth by the events preceding the Independence War, and after the war naturalized as a Martian Citizen, joining the Valkyrie program at MARSpace. David is single, attractive, and most importantly, he likes dogs.

>remember grues
That doesn't ring a bell.

>remember janet
You are Janet Xiang, age 36, citizen of Mars, and employee of MARSpace. You grew up in the suburbs of Cydonia, and your mother taught Applied Cybernetics at U of C. Your father was an environmental technician who worked at the local reclamation center. Like many Martian women of your generation, you intended to wed early, and you were engaged to Tomasz Kowalski when the Independence War began. Tomasz was working in the power station located on Phobos when that moon was destroyed. The same day, you adopted your dog, Rover, whose owners were killed during an attack which destroyed part of the U of C. You have raised him from a puppy, and he is your most loyal friend.

Rover walks around the room, occasionally sniffing various spots on the floor.

>remember mars
Mars has been home to your family for three generations, your grandparents having been life contractors for the Myomita corporation. Since its colonization by national and later corporate entities beginning more than two hundred years ago, Mars has been subservient to the interests of Earth. Since the Independence War, the situation has improved, and income from off-world commerce is slowly balancing the equation.

>remember tomasz
Tomasz was your fiancé five years ago. You had planned to get married on Mons Olympus and to honeymoon at Club Meridian on the equator.

>x rover
He's a big, happy dalmation.

>remember rover
Rover is your dog, a five-year-old dalmation. When his original owners were killed during the Independence War, you adopted him as a puppy. He is a clever dog, and you have taught him to perform a number of tricks on command. Rover is house trained but loves to explore outside. He can be trusted to go out on his own, and he always comes back.

>remember me

>remember valkyrie
The potential for interstellar commerce has been constrained by time and distance. Although condensate drive has allowed vessels to reach nearby stars, it is expensive and slow and holds little promise for commercial exploitation. The Valkyrie is the first ship to incorporate the Casimir Drive, giving it unprecedented speed and range. It is rumored that since the Valkyrie project fell into MARSpace hands after the Independence War, Earth's Myomita corporation has been working on a sister ship based on similar technology.

Rover rests his front paws on the window and stares out at the Park.

>remember cydonia
You don't have many memories of Cydonia itself despite having grown up just a few klicks from the city center -- and it is not like you had time to go there as a graduate student. You recall Cydonia's overly complicated public transport systems, the food vendors who ply the walkways with their tempting carts of fried food, and the tube-people who beg for money.

>remember myomita
The Myomita Corporation is Earth's largest zaibatsu, with a strangle hold on Earth's computer and space exploration sectors. For all intents and purposes, Myomita is Earth's government. The company is based in Kyoto but has offices throughout the Solar System. The company is controlled by the Ishegawa family, who follow a profit-oriented reinterpretation of the bushido code. The company is ruthless and unforgiving but unquestionably successful.

Rover paces back and forth, looking at the front door.

>remember earth
Earth began colonizing Mars in the International days, back when Earth was more or less divided up regionally into noncorporate governments. In principle, governments still exist on Earth as limited not-for-profit corporations, but zaibatsu such as Myomita control the purse strings and therefore are effectively in charge.

Although it is hard to separate Arean agitprop from hard news, it sounds like life on Earth is none to pleasant these days: population 60 billion, most people living under water, high taxes, restrictive laws, excessive fines, and a surfeit of lawyers. You can certainly understand why so many opt for the colonies, as inclement as they tend to be.

>pet rover
You rub Rover's chest and his back leg fiddles.

>rover, hi
There is no reply.

>look under bed
It's too early to delve into the dust-bunny infested recesses of the futon. Certainly not before some strong coffee.

>l
Living Room
You are in the living room of a small cottage. Piped-in sunlight pours in through the room's single window, illuminating a framed picture on the opposite wall. The principal furnishing is a king-size purple futon which takes up almost all the floor space. From the living room you can see the entrance to the kitchen and bathroom. The cottage's front door is closed.

On the purple futon is an alarm clock.

You can also see Rover here.

Rover lies down next to the drapes.

>x drapes
The heavy brown drapes are open. Light pours in.

Rover tucks his nose under his front paws.

>x janet
You seem just like you have every other day of your life. You are wearing a MARSpace standard issue flight suit.

Rover crouches in preparation for a hop onto the futon when he catches your eye and cleverly transitions into a stretching posture. He walks away from the futon, glad not to have been caught again on the furniture.

>x david
Your boss isn't here.


David: Why would it expect to see me in your cottage?
Janet: Probably a random association.
David: Do you think the ACU can hear us talking?
Janet: That's a philosophical issue. It has sound sensors,
       and they might be on, but it's all bits. Bits in,
       bits out. I don't think you could say that it really
       hears us in any meaningful way.

>david, hi
Your boss isn't here.


David: Again, about me!
Janet: Whoa Nelly, let's reign in that ego, cowboy. 

>ask david about acu
Your boss isn't here.

>x suit
You are wearing a loose-fitting blue flight suit with a MARSpace insignia. Some letters are also sewn above the insignia.

>x letters
The letters on the flight suit are embroidered in white on a red background.

>x insignia
The insignia depicts the planet Mars. A pulp novel rocket ship points away from the globe of Mars and towards space. The picture evokes the spear and sword of Ares, the symbol of Mars back to alchemical times.

Rover circles the window.

>read letters
There are only three letters: "ACU".



David: If the ACU knows what you know, why doesn't the ACU
       realize that it is the ACU? I mean, isn't that what
       you would suspect if you woke up in a flight suit
       labeled ACU?
Janet: Cognitive constraints are implemented - the willing
       suspension of disbelief is a programmatic imperative.
David: I love it when you use big words!
Janet: You are a doofus, sir.

>remove suit
You take off your blue flight suit and it falls to the living room floor. You are naked.



David: I don't think I should be seeing this. I mean, I'm
       your boss. There's that whole power dynamic thing.
Janet: Don't worry: I'm not inclined to sue you for staring
       at a simulation.
David: I'm not staring at the stimulation.
Janet: You said stimulation. That's funny.
David: No, I said simulation - and I'm not staring.
Janet: Alright -- you're the boss.

>x me
You seem just like you have every other day of your life.

By the way, it's not a big deal because you're in your own cottage, but it's worth mentioning that you are in your birthday suit.

>touch me
You feel normal. Nothing out of the ordinary, really.

>wear suit
(first taking the flight suit)
You put on the flight suit.

>i
You are carrying:

Rover scratches his ears.

>x ears
Which do you mean, parts, or the Rover?

>parts
You can't see any such thing.

>x rover
He's a gentle, obedient dalmation.

Living Room
You are in the living room of a small cottage. Piped-in sunlight pours in through the room's single window, illuminating a framed picture on the opposite wall. The principal furnishing is a king-size purple futon which takes up almost all the floor space. From the living room you can see the entrance to the kitchen and bathroom. The cottage's front door is closed.

On the purple futon is an alarm clock.

You can also see Rover here.

>verbose
Rover's Day Out is now in its "verbose" mode, which always gives long descriptions of locations (even if you've been there before).

>score
There is no score in this story.

>xyzzy
That's not a verb I recognize.

>e
Compass directions? On Mars? The magnetic field here is too weak.

>enter kitchen
You can't really move around much because of the futon. It takes up a lot of room.



David: Isn't that a tad inconvenient?
Janet: Yeah, but it kind of made sense when I got it.

>close futon
With a little effort, the futon folds up, snug against the wall, leaving more room to walk around the cramped cottage.

Rover hears something from outside and peers out the window, searching.

>x window
The window is triple-paned pressure glass, mounted flush with the wall.  Through the window you can see an array of skylights, a park, some grass, and some trees.

Rover looks around the room.

>enter kitchen
Kitchen
The kitchen is small but functional, with a space-saver refrigerator and a glass-top electric range. There is a drawer under the range. On the opposite wall there is a sink and under it, a storage cabinet.

You can see a water bowl (empty) and a food bowl (empty) here.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover walking about.

>x fridge
The small refrigerator dates back to the International Era, but is still in good working order, if somewhat small by today's standards. The glossy, white enameled unit has a single compartment. A strip of yellow magpaper is attached to the refrigerator door.



David: Isn't a "to-do" list a little heavy handed?
Janet: Sure, but stuff has to happen in a certain order,
       and it's just more efficient this way.
David: I think it would be better if it were less linear
       and more rule-based.
Janet: Okay, mister critic, then you write the code. If we
       want to recover that probe before Earth gets to it,
       we are on a very tight development and testing schedule.

>x range
The top of the glass range is flush with the kitchen counter. The surface of the stove is not glowing, indicating that it is not hot. The stove does not have an oven, but below the cooking surface, a drawer is flush with the kitchen counter.

>x drawer
A deep drawer under the the cooking range. The drawer is shut.

A small, utilitarian kitchen sink. Below the sink, there is a small cabinet.

If you moved the "to do" list, you'd need another note to remind you where you put the list. Better to just leave it there.

>touch range
The stove is cool to the touch.

>open drawer
You open the drawer, revealing a frying pan.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover jumping around.

>x pan
A small, non-stick frying pan .

>get it
Taken.

>search drawer
The drawer is empty.

>close it
You close the drawer.

>turn on sink
You run the water momentarily, and then turn off the tap to conserve water.

>open cabinet
You open the cabinet, revealing a reward nugget replicator and a 20 kilo bag of dog chow.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover growling at something.

>fill water bowl
(first taking the water bowl)
You run the sink briefly to make sure the water is cold, and then fill Rover's bowl about halfway up.

Rover wanders into the kitchen when he hears water splashing into his bowl.

Rover is obviously waiting for you to give him a bowl.

He notices the lack of food in his soi-disant food bowl. He looks at you with imploring puppy dog eyes and then back again at his empty food bowl.

>x replicator
A small, bright red device labeled "Reward Nugget Replicator". It sports a picture of a dog with angel wings and a halo above its head. In compliance with the Ministry of Waste Management's ordinances, the device will only produce a dog treat when Rover has consumed the previous one. It's a feature.

Rover stares longingly at the bowl in your hand.

>x bag
The open bag features a picture of a grotesquely (in your opinion) fat white husky seated at a fancy dinner table. In front of him, steak, turkey, and ham are piled high on silver dishes. He stares rapaciously at the feast, clenching a fork and knife in his paws. The bag is labeled "Fill your best friend's bowl with Happy Dogz Mix!"

Rover outright gapes at the bowl you carry, then gently sniffs it in hope that you'll give it to him.

He narrows his eyes critically, noting the lack of food in his food bowl. He paws pathetically at the food bowl, and the hollow, tin ring of the pitiful bowl echoes through the kitchen.

>drop water bowl
Rover sighs audibly and frowns at his food bowl. He looks at the food bowl. He looks at you. He looks at the food bowl. He looks at you.

Rover's tongue is a blur as he laps up the water, draining the water bowl in seconds.

>open bag
That's already open.

>search it
In the 20 kilo bag of dog chow are some doggie kibbles.

>smell kibbles
You're not very keen to reach into a bag of stinky dog food.

>eat kibbles
Eww. Yech. So not.

Rover rubs his nose.

>fill food bowl
(first taking the food bowl)
(first taking the bag of dog chow)
You  empty the bag of dog chow into Rover's bowl, giving him a generous portion that should more than carry him through a day's worth of Rover antics.

Rover watches with interest as you fill his food bowl.

Rover tingles with anticipation as he stares at the bowl you're carrying.

>drop it
Rover gulps down the food, without pausing for niceties such as breathing.

>fill water
(first taking the water bowl)
You run the sink briefly to make sure the water is cold, and then fill Rover's bowl about halfway up.

Rover looks towards the sink as you fill his water bowl.

>drop it
>fill food
You can't fill that.

>fill food bowl
(first taking the food bowl)
There are no more kibbles in the bag.

Rover sniffs the water bowl.

>x bag
The open bag features a picture of a grotesquely (in your opinion) fat white husky seated at a fancy dinner table. In front of him, steak, turkey, and ham are piled high on silver dishes. He stares rapaciously at the feast, clenching a fork and knife in his paws. The bag is labeled "Fill your best friend's bowl with Happy Dogz Mix!"

Kitchen
The kitchen is small but functional, with a space-saver refrigerator and a glass-top electric range. There is a drawer under the range. On the opposite wall there is a sink and under it, an open storage cabinet.

You can see a water bowl (in which is some water) and Rover here.

Rover walks towards the water bowl.

>search cabinet
In the cabinet is a reward nugget replicator.

Rover exhales with contentment and rolls over, legs outstretched.

>replicate nugget
That's not a verb I recognize.

>x nugget replicator
A small, bright red device labeled "Reward Nugget Replicator". It sports a picture of a dog with angel wings and a halo above its head. In compliance with the Ministry of Waste Management's ordinances, the device will only produce a dog treat when Rover has consumed the previous one. It's a feature.

David: So that was another random association? It seemed
       pretty purposeful to me.
Janet: With the cognitive constraints in place, it would
       have to be, although the synaptic scan might be somewhat
       confounded because I was working on the program when
       the scan was made.
David: Kind of like a feedback loop?
Janet: No, not at all.
David: Hmph.

>get replicator
A dog treat rattles around in the replicator as you pick it up. Rover stares at the box of treats, successfully suppressing the urge to drool. For the moment.

>open it
That's not something you can open.

Rover wags his tail as if amused by some random thought.

>x box
You can't see any such thing.

>get treat from replicator
Taken.

>x treat
A bone-shaped dog treat. It doesn't seem very appetizing to you, but Rover likes them.

Rover looks at the the cooking range.

>give it to rover
Rover nearly takes your hand off in rush to swallow the treat. A series of emotions wash over Rover's face, but finally it settles into an expression of exultation.

>get treat
Taken.

>throw it
Dropped.

Rover looks down and devours the dog treat.

>pet rover
You rub Rover under the chin, and he cranes back his neck and twists his head from side to side in enjoyment.

Kitchen
The kitchen is small but functional, with a space-saver refrigerator and a glass-top electric range. There is a drawer under the range. On the opposite wall there is a sink and under it, an open storage cabinet.

You can see a water bowl (in which is some water) and Rover here.

>open fridge
Rover looks up when he hears the old fridge open. He sniffs the fridge door and decides there is nothing in the fridge worth getting in trouble over. He saunters out of the kitchen and back towards the living room.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover sniffing something.

>search it
You poke around in the fridge and find a white egg.

>x egg
A big white neoegg.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover snoring softly (in the sense that it probably can't be heard outside of the cottage).

>get it
You pluck the white egg out of the fridge.


Janet: It's a shame we don't have enough heavy helium to
       bring the ship back.
David: I'm afraid we've put all our baskets in one egg, as
       it were. That one egg represents every bit of heavy
       helium refined on Mars since Phobos was destroyed.
Janet: All Your Egg Are Belong to Us?
David: Huh? Didn't quite catch that.
Janet: Never mind.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover breathing quietly (quietly for Rover, who is a heavy breather).

>search fridge
You poke around in the fridge and find nothing at all.

>turn on range
Your stove is a Cupertino SmartRange® -- there are no controls, just a stylish glass surface with rounded corners.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover chewing something.

>put pan on range
You put the frying pan on the the cooking range.

>crack egg
That would make a mess. You'd only break the egg into a pan.

>put egg in pan
You put the white egg into the frying pan.

>x egg
A big white neoegg.

>crack egg in pan
You feel kind of grimy and not entirely awake. From past experience you know that cooking before your morning shower often ends in disaster.  (This is why you have your list hanging on the fridge!)  You put the egg and the frying pan aside for the moment.

>out
It took a lot of training to get Rover to eat it in the kitchen, so rather than walk out with a bag of dog food, you put it back in the cabinet. Rover can be a messy eater.  By force of habit you never take dog bowls out of the kitchen, so you set the food bowl down before continuing on your way.

Rover strolls into the kitchen to investigate the promising sound of clinking dog bowls.


Living Room
You are in the living room of a small cottage. Piped-in sunlight pours in through the room's single window, illuminating a framed picture on the opposite wall. The principal furnishing is a king-size purple futon which takes up almost all the floor space. From the living room you can see the entrance to the kitchen and bathroom. The cottage's front door is closed.

On the purple futon is an alarm clock.

>enter bathroom
Bathroom
Your cottage's living room is palatial compared to your bathroom. There is a pink marble counter and above it you've mounted a mirror on the wall. To the right of the mirror is a black glass plate. Between the counter and the shower is a white, porcelain toilet.

On the marble counter are a toothbrush and a plastic box.

Rover trundles along behind you, his attention riveted to the reward nugget replicator.

>x counter
A counter of that pink faux marble that is so common in Martian bathrooms. On it are a toothbrush and a plastic box.

>x mirror
You see yourself in the mirror: a young woman with dark brown hair, high cheekbones and a look of determination.



David: Wait, is that memory usage correct?
Janet: Sure, it's fairly conservative. The system has 640
       PB available.
David: That's it?
Janet: C'mon, nobody will ever need more than 640 PB.

>x plate
A glossy black plate that is just to the right of the bathroom mirror.

Rover licks his front paws.

>x toilet
A plain vanilla toilet, having a water tank and bowl. Nothing to write home about. Someone left both the cover and seat up. How rude.

A plunger stands next to the toilet, between it and the shower.

>x toothbrush
A green sonic toothbrush with slightly worn bristles.

>x box
A small plastic box labeled "Tooth Floss," with a blue button just below where the floss comes out.

>look under counter
You find nothing of interest.

Rover cocks his head and ogles the toilet.

>touch plate
The heat lamp senses that you are not wet. Its power conservation settings prevent it from turning on.

>x tank
A porcelain reservoir containing several liters of water to flush the toilet. On the front of the tank there is a silver knob used to flush the toilet and on the top of the tank there is a lid.

>x bowl
The white porcelain bowl is the bottom part of the toilet. Someone left both the cover and seat up. How rude.

>x cover
The cover is made of plastic but has been laminated to give it the appearance of unstained wood. The toilet cover is closed.

>x seat
A padded and heated seat, which is presently raised.

>x plunger
A common plumber's plunger, consisting of a wooden shaft and red rubber cup. Something about the plunger just doesn't look proper. The handle of the plunger is tilted completely forwards and it's also leaning completely to the right.

>x blue button
A blue plastic button on the side of the ergonomically designed plastic box.

Rover turns suddenly, as if he might have seen a skwerrel.

>x knob
A silver-plated knob on upper part of the toilet's water tank.

Rover stares at his own paws, entirely entranced.

>x lid
A lid made of the same porcelain material as the water tank itself.

>open lid
You open the water tank, revealing a flapper valve, a metapropylene lever, and a flush chain.

Rover prances past you at a convenient back-scratching distance.

>get plunger
Since the day Tomasz jammed the plunger down on the bathroom floor, it has been stuck there like a barbed harpoon in the side of a great whale. Well, maybe more like a giant squid wrapped around an unfortunate whale, since squids have (you have heard) suckers. Some kind of weird interaction between the rubber cup and the micropores in the floor have effectively bonded the plunger to the floor, and any attempt to remove it would probably destroy one or the other. The plunger doesn't really bother you, and most of the time you just ignore it.

>x valve
A black rubber valve that seals the bottom of the water tank, allowing the toilet to flush only when it is pulled upward by the chain that connects it to the flush lever.

>x lever
The small white metapropylene lever on the inside of the water tank pivots up and down when the silver knob on the outside of the tank is turned. The lever in turn pulls on the chain that runs down to the flapper valve.

>x chain
A metal chain that connects the flush lever to the flapper valve.

Rover cocks his head and ogles the plunger.

>x floor
The black bathroom floor sparkles thanks to microscopic bits of volcanic glass which ensure that the floor is never slippery, even when wet. The micropores in the floor also ensure that water does not collect for long on the bathroom floor.

>touch it
The bathroom floor feels like ultrafine pumice.

>search tank
The hardware that makes the toilet work can be seen within the tank. A plastic lever goes up and down according to the position of a silver knob on the outside of the tank, pulling on a chain that operates a flapper valve.

>open valve
You reach in to lift the black rubber valve at the bottom of the toilet.

The cottage's EcoSensor inhibits the flush. Water isn't as expensive as it used to be in the International days, but there's no sense in wasting it willy-nilly with unnecessary flushing.

>remove suit
You take off your blue flight suit and it falls to the bathroom floor. You are naked.

Rover looks at the bathroom sink.

>use toilet
You're willing to hold it until you can sit down properly on a toilet seat, thank you very much.

Sitting on the ceramic rim of the toilet bowl would be absolutely too gross to contemplate.

Gut-wrenching flavor aside, it would be a bureaucratic nightmare to describe to the Ministry of Waste Management how replicated matter ended up in the human waste stream (effectively short-circuiting their carefully balanced ecology). Reminded of where replicated matter comes from, you decide not to eat the treat.

Rover's Day Out
An Interactive Simulation by Janet Xiang
Release beta810 / Serial number 23920415 / Inform 10.6 build Mu-013 (I6/v.7.1 lib 7/18N)

Rover sniffs the air and tears away from the picnic blanket. You and Tomasz watch with surprise as he runs, for once, away from the food. Rover bounds over the hedges, howling wildly, and spooks a xihuahua that had been playing with a tiny red ball. The so-called "shaved rat" gulps an oversized portion of air, extends its membranous ears, and flies across the park into the arms of a stooped grey-haired woman with a cane. Rover picks up the ball triumphantly, ignoring the piercing wavetrain of yips and indignant scolding coming, respectively, from the xihuahua and its owner. Shaking her cane limply towards Rover, she admonishes in a strong Earth accent "That mongrel should be on a leash!" Her own, unleashed, uncollared neodog stares accusingly from the safety of her arms, its distensible ribs alternately inflating and deflating like bellows. "Your kind is ruining Mars, ignoring every law, dissing your elders! You never lived on the surface, you never don't know what you've got!". You try to give the ball back to her, but she pushes it away in disgust, "Kids. Meh."



David: Hey, different dream sequence. Is it glitching?
Janet: No, the ACU's dreams are heavily influenced by power-up
       state of the processor and internal noise. Every time
       the ship dehibernates after a Casimir jump, it will
       experience some sort of dreaming. Some of them can
       be pretty bizarre.
David: Good, I'd hate to think that we wasted two weeks of
       programming.
Janet: I wouldn't say wasted.
David: Huh? I didn't mean us.
Janet: Cross your fingers and hope the whole thing doesn't
       crash again on the heat lamp.

The image of Tomasz blinks momentarily as the relay is handed off from ground station to ground station, trying to keep line of sight to Phobos. Behind him, you can see the tubular structure of the power station jutting over the edge of Stickley Crater. He is taking the news rather well, all things considered. Tomasz guesses your thoughts as you glance at your diamond engagement ring. "Don't sweat it,"he says. "This whole rock is carbon, so plenty more where that came from." There is a blinding flash of light and the screen goes black.



David: Is the ACU referring to me?
Janet: As much as I'd like to say "yes", I don't see how.
       The synaptic scans were frozen before we started seeing
       each other.
David: Maybe you've had your eye on me for longer than you

An angry dwarf emerges from under the kitchen sink, spilling dog chow all over the floor. He throws you a menacing look, pries the fridge open with a black rod, and snatches an egg off the shelf. Sand pours out of the fridge. "Hey," you yell from the futon, "put that back". You stop short, realizing that this sort of distraction is exactly why you haven't completed your dissertation. You feel around under the futon, where you think you will have put the dissertation so you could find it in the past, and grab the stubby snout of a pig. The fleet-footed porcine slaps a fish into its ear, jumps into a dumbwaiter and disappears.

You try to remember some of the steps that you and Tomasz learned during your ill-fated attempt at ballroom dancing. You think you recall the lambada, but perhaps you're mixing it up with the rumba. Rumba, lambada, what's the difference in the grand scheme of things?

>sing
You quietly sing a short song that Tomasz had taught you. The song is about a lonely colony ship engineer who pines for his sweetheart back on Earth.

>close futon
With a little effort, the futon folds up, snug against the wall, leaving more room to walk around the cramped cottage.

>x futon
Your futon is huge, and oh so comfy. It is far too large to be practical in your minimalist living room, particularly when the futon is unfolded. The wooden frame supports a king-size mattress. An alarm clock is balanced precariously near the edge of the futon.



David: Maybe the problem isn't that the futon is too big,
       but that the apartment is too small.
Janet: No, the problem is the futon. If the futon were a
       cantaloupe of the same size, it would still be too
       large.
David: I can't argue with that logic.
Janet: That's why you're management and why I do the computer
       programming.

>open drapes
You push aside the drapes.

Living Room
You are in the living room of a small cottage. Piped-in sunlight pours in through the room's single window, illuminating a framed picture on the opposite wall. The principal furnishing is a king-size purple futon which takes up almost all the floor space. From the living room you can see the entrance to the kitchen and bathroom. The cottage's front door is closed.

On the purple futon is an alarm clock.

You can also see Rover here.

>x window
The window is triple-paned pressure glass, mounted flush with the wall.  Through the window you can see an array of skylights, a park, some grass, and some trees.



David: Look, you can almost see my cottage over there, behind
       the Spruce trees.
Janet: The Douglas Firs?
David: No, I mean the Norway Spruce, over there.
Janet: I know which one you mean, and believe me, they are
       Douglas Firs.
David: I concede. Can we make up now?

>x cottage
You can't see any such thing.

A line of tall, dark green trees stands at the far edge of the park.

Kitchen
The kitchen is small but functional, with a space-saver refrigerator and a glass-top electric range. There is a drawer under the range. On the opposite wall there is a sink and under it, a storage cabinet.

You can see a food bowl (empty) and a water bowl (in which is some water) here.



David: Where are your coffee machine and toaster?
Janet: I mapped the ship functions to the minimum number
       of objects. More objects means more ways for things
       to go wrong and more time debugging. Call me lazy.
David: Lazy.
Janet: You don't know the crazy things the ACU does! Sometimes
       it walks around trying to eat or take everything in
       sight. Sometimes it sings and jumps around. It's based
       on my neural bindings, but the ACU definitely has
       a mind of its own, and I don't want to have to worry
       about what it might try do with a toaster.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover walking in your direction.

That's plainly inedible.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover dragging something around.

>get rover

>fill water bowl
(first taking the water bowl)
The water bowl is already full.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover doing whatever it is he does when he's not out for walkies and he thinks he's out of your sight.

>drop water bowl
Rover runs into the kitchen, his rear end making a wide, sliding turn on the living room's hardwood floor as he rounds the corner.

Rover must have been thirsty. One moment the water bowl is full; the next, it's bone dry.

>x it
A simple metal bowl labeled "water". The water bowl is empty.

>fill it
(first taking the water bowl)
You run the sink briefly to make sure the water is cold, and then fill Rover's bowl about halfway up.

Rover looks towards the sink as you fill his water bowl.

Rover stares longingly at the bowl in your hand.

>drop it
>get food bowl
Taken.

Rover tingles with anticipation as he stares at the bowl you're carrying.

>open cabinet
You open the cabinet, revealing a reward nugget replicator and a 20 kilo bag of dog chow.

Rover is obviously waiting for you to give him a bowl.

>x food
A simple metal bowl. It is identical to the water bowl, except for the word "food" that appears on its side. The food bowl is empty.

Rover outright gapes at the bowl you carry, then gently sniffs it in hope that you'll give it to him.

>fill food bowl
(first taking the bag of dog chow)
You  empty the bag of dog chow into Rover's bowl, giving him a generous portion that should more than carry him through a day's worth of Rover antics.

Rover watches with interest as you fill his food bowl.

Rover outright gapes at the bowl you carry, then gently sniffs it in hope that you'll give it to him.

>drop it
Rover makes short work of the food in his bowl.

>x bag
The open bag features a picture of a grotesquely (in your opinion) fat white husky seated at a fancy dinner table. In front of him, steak, turkey, and ham are piled high on silver dishes. He stares rapaciously at the feast, clenching a fork and knife in his paws. The bag is labeled "Fill your best friend's bowl with Happy Dogz Mix!"

>get it
You already have that.

Rover stretches all the way forwards, and then all the way backwards.

>i
You are carrying:

Rover circles the the cooking range.

You close the cabinet.

>x range
The top of the glass range is flush with the kitchen counter. The surface of the stove is not glowing, indicating that it is not hot. The stove does not have an oven, but below the cooking surface, a drawer is flush with the kitchen counter.

Kitchen
The kitchen is small but functional, with a space-saver refrigerator and a glass-top electric range. There is a drawer under the range. On the opposite wall there is a sink and under it, a storage cabinet.

Rover appears lost in thought.

>open drawer
You open the drawer, revealing a frying pan.

>get pan
Taken.

>wear it
You can't wear that!

>eat it
That's plainly inedible.

>out
It took a lot of training to get Rover to eat it in the kitchen, so rather than walk out with a bag of dog food, you put it back in the cabinet.

Bathroom
Your cottage's living room is palatial compared to your bathroom. There is a pink marble counter and above it you've mounted a mirror on the wall. To the right of the mirror is a black glass plate. Between the counter and the shower is a white, porcelain toilet.

On the marble counter are a plastic box and a toothbrush.



Janet: Let's hope the simulation doesn't crash again. I'd
       really like to run it all the way through to the Rover
       release.
David: It's looked good this far.

>save
Ok.

>brush teeth
(first grabbing the toothbrush)
The toothbrush sprays each tooth with a fizzy foam, vibrates it into lather and rinses. Your teeth feel smooth and your breath is much improved.

>floss teeth
You don't have any floss.

>push button
(first taking the plastic box)
You grab a strand of light green dental floss as it reels out of the dispenser.

Mmm. Quite tasty.

>push button
You grab a strand of light green dental floss as it reels out of the dispenser.

The plastic box beeps, indicating that it is waiting for you to use the dental floss that it has already dispensed. Never underestimate the intelligence of your average plastic box.

From the direction of the kitchen, you hear Rover barking at something.

>out
The last time you walked out of the bathroom with your toothbrush, you never found it again. You toss it on the counter. The plastic box almost makes it out of the bathroom, but you remember to set it down before stepping out.

Two buttons are molded into the wall of the shower stall. One is labeled "soap", and the other, "shampoo". The shower has not activated because you are still wearing clothes.



David: I should probably check on the Casimir Drive harmonic
       suppressor; it still isn't stable.
Janet: I'd like you to see everything.

Janet: I thought it might be too distracting for the ACU.

You wash your hair. It no longer feels like a straw-encrusted swarm of yellow-headed tommygoffs.


Janet: David, what's the ablative coating for? I thought
       that most of that planet's atmosphere had been cooked
       off long ago.
David: Not really my department. Maybe it's supposed to help
       with the heat.
Janet: I've heard temps up to 1000 Kelvin?
David: In that ballpark. They think the probe impacted on

You adjust the plunger handle leftwards. Nope. It looks even worse now.

Something about the plunger just doesn't look proper. The handle of the plunger is leaning a little bit to the left.

David: I had my fingers crossed too.

A plain vanilla toilet, having a water tank and bowl. Nothing to write home about. The toilet seat is down, but the cover is raised.

A plunger stands next to the toilet, between it and the shower.

>open tank
That's already open.

From the direction of the kitchen, you hear Rover walking in your direction.

>x valve
A black rubber valve that seals the bottom of the water tank, allowing the toilet to flush only when it is pulled upward by the chain that connects it to the flush lever.

>search tank
The hardware that makes the toilet work can be seen within the tank. A plastic lever goes up and down according to the position of a silver knob on the outside of the tank, pulling on a chain that operates a flapper valve.

>x lever
The small white metapropylene lever on the inside of the water tank pivots up and down when the silver knob on the outside of the tank is turned. The lever in turn pulls on the chain that runs down to the flapper valve.

>x chain
A metal chain that connects the flush lever to the flapper valve.

Rover looks up when he hears the old fridge open. He sniffs the fridge door and decides there is nothing in the fridge worth getting in trouble over. He saunters out of the kitchen and back towards the living room.

>get egg
Taken.

>break it into pan
You crack the egg into the frying pan. The neoegg shell sublimates as the contents spread over the pan's non-stick surface. 

>put pan on stove
Immediately, the surface of the range glows red. When the egg is cooked sunny-side up to perfection, the glow fades.


Janet: If there were some heavy helium left after landing,
       could the ship take off again?
David: Hypothetically, yes, but the planet has essentially
       no atmosphere to break against and it has about nine
       times Earth gravity. Even with optimal approach we'll
       have to fuse every gram of that heavy helium to make
       a soft landing.
Janet: I just hate to leave the ship there. It could take
       years before our next Casimir ship will be built,
       and who knows if Valkyrie will survive that long on
       that chthonian rock.
David: Nice word. From MARSpace perspective, all that matters
       is that the probe data are recovered.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover entertaining himself.

>x egg
A perfectly fried egg: The yellow yolk lies at the geometric center of a white disc, like the star at the center of a nascent system. The yolk is just a notch short of congealing, and the white is neither runny nor burnt. Another culinary success.

It's a little drafty in your cottage without any clothes on.

>get it
To eat the egg or not. That is the question.

>eat it
You gobble down what might well have been the best neoegg you've ever had.


David: Wait a minute! She just scoops the egg out of the
       pan with her hand and eats it like a grizzly bear
       raking salmon out of a river?
Janet: Works for me, yeah.
David: How about a plate and fork?
Janet: The ACU doesn't miss them, and it's less programming
       overhead. And bonus: fewer dishes to clean.

>x pan
A small, non-stick frying pan .

>i
You are carrying nothing.

>open cabinet
You open the cabinet, revealing a 20 kilo bag of dog chow and a reward nugget replicator.

>get bag

You make a mental note to wear some clothes before going to work today.

>put it in food bowl
(first taking the food bowl)
There are no more kibbles in the bag.

>get bag
You already have that.

>get replicator
A dog treat rattles around in the replicator as you pick it up. Rover is suddenly standing next to you, eyes wide open, and fixed on the reward nugget replicator.

Without your flight suit, you feel naked. Because you are.

>think about david
David Venkatachalam, age 42, citizen of Mars, and Project Leader for the Valkyrie program. David was raised in an undersea community just north of Sri Lanka, so he had less difficulty adapting to Mars and its life support requirements than most Earthers. He studied mathematics in New Delhi and Novosibirsk before working on theoretical aspects of the Casimir propulsion system at Myomita Corporation in Sapporo. He was cut off from Earth by the events preceding the Independence War, and after the war naturalized as a Martian Citizen, joining the Valkyrie program at MARSpace. David is single, attractive, and most importantly, he likes dogs.

You smell fresh and clean.

>out
It took a lot of training to get Rover to eat it in the kitchen, so rather than walk out with a bag of dog food, you put it back in the cabinet. Rover can be a messy eater.  By force of habit you never take dog bowls out of the kitchen, so you set the food bowl down before continuing on your way.

On the marble counter are a plastic box and a toothbrush.

You can also see a flight suit here.

Rover trundles along behind you, his attention riveted to the reward nugget replicator.



Janet: So now we begin the landing cycle. This is where the
       ACU really shines.
David: What about timing? The ship has to be in the right
       orientation to fire the fusion thrusters at exactly
       the right time.
Janet: The ACU works so fast that no matter how many individual
       steps it takes, the effect occurs at the right time.

Janet: When Rover brings the probe back to the ship, it will
       automatically extract the data and send it back by
       ansible. Did you enter the ansible parameters?
David: Yes, I had to do it manually, since the frequency
       and coordinates are encrypted. It's too bad they didn't
       have FTL communications when they built the probes
       -- it would have saved us the trip.
Janet: Yes, but then Earth would get the information as well
       -- even encrypted, I wouldn't want it to fall into
       their hands.

>open door
Rover looks up when he hears the door begin to open. Rover slips out the door.



Janet: So, that's it. Rover goes out, gets the probe, and
       brings it back to the ship, and then the information
       is squirted back to MARSpace.
David: Well, congratulations, Doctor Xiang, on a job well
       done. I say we celebrate tonight, and get up early
       for the launch tomorrow morning.
Janet: It's a deal. Give me ten minutes to make the final
       commit, and I'll join you.
David: I'll put the champagne on ice.

Rover's Day Out
An Interactive Simulation by Janet Xiang and David Venkatachalam
Release 1 / Serial number 23920416 / Inform 10.6 build Mu-013 (I6/v.7.1 lib 7/18N)

Even mildly drugged and reclining on an overstuffed couch in the MARSpace human resources office, it's hard to relax in the presence of the MARSpace political officer conducting the final interview. You didn't catch her name, probably because she never mentioned it. After three such interviews and six months of background check, what more could they want?  

"Ms. Xiang, thank you for your cooperation. Your tests show no hint of disloyalty to the Republic or MARSpace. We hope you understand the need for these measures, particularly for personnel with access to the Valkyrie's command and control functions. Now that you are cleared, I can inform you that credible sources have warned that the project may have been infiltrated by..."

<BEEP> <BEEP> <BEEP>

You weren't particularly enjoying this dream, but being jarred awake by a violently shaking futon is even less pleasurable.

As the bed bucks and tumbles, several scenarios flash through your mind: explosive decompression of the dome? Volcanic activity? Meteor impact? Before you can even consider your next action, you are thrown from the futon onto the living room floor. Light pours in from the window. It looks like the drapes were somehow torn away from the window.

>look
Living Room
You are in the living room of a small cottage. Piped-in sunlight pours in through the room's single window, illuminating a framed picture on the opposite wall -- strangely, your drapes are nowhere to be seen. The principal furnishing is a king-size purple futon which takes up almost all the floor space. From the living room you can see the entrance to the kitchen and bathroom. The cottage's front door is closed.

You can see an alarm clock and Rover here.

Rover dashes back and forth like a possessed dog for no apparent reason.

>save
Ok.

>x rover
He's young as dogs go, about 5 years old, so not a puppy either, although he's almost as playful at times.

>x window
Whatever woke you up this morning did some damage. The cottage's window is built to withstand damage, but thin cracks have appeared throughout it. The garden skylights are just coming on. They cast long shadows from a stand of Norwegian Spruce trees at the far side of the park.

>x fir
A line of tall, dark green Norway Spruce trees stands at the far edge of the park.

>x cracks

Rover sniffs the window.

>x picture
A picture of the Starship Valkyrie, still under construction in drydock. You notice that a few pixels have gone dark in the picture. Not a big deal, though. Probably only something you'd notice. There is small brass nameplate below the picture.

>read nameplate
It says, "Good luck at MARSpace! - Tomasz"

Tomasz's valediction makes you remember happier times...

Your late fiancé gave you the photo when you began working on the Valkyrie Project as a graduate student -- a happier time before the Independence War with Earth, and the attacks on Mars by Earth's Myomita Corporation. Back then, Valkyrie's experimental Casimir Drive was an exciting technological adventure, rather than a military priority. Now the Valkyrie is Mars' only chance to recover data from a recently discovered space probe marooned in deep space. For whatever reason, MARSpace feels that probe could hold information that could finally give Mars the upper hand in its competition with Earth.

Living Room
You are in the living room of a small cottage. Piped-in sunlight pours in through the room's single window, illuminating a framed picture on the opposite wall -- strangely, your drapes are nowhere to be seen. The principal furnishing is a king-size purple futon which takes up almost all the floor space. From the living room you can see the entrance to the kitchen and bathroom. The cottage's front door is closed.

You can see an alarm clock and Rover here.

>x clock
It's a cheap, white plastic alarm clock with fading green LEDs that read 5:38 am.  A large button juts out of the top.

>press button
The alarm clock says "You are awake enough."

>enter kitchen
You can't really move around much because of the futon. It takes up a lot of room.

Rover prances past you at a convenient back-scratching distance.

>close futon
With a little effort, the futon folds up, snug against the wall, leaving more room to walk around the cramped cottage.

Rover walks around the room, occasionally sniffing various spots on the floor.

>look under it
It's too early to delve into the dust-bunny infested recesses of the futon. Certainly not before some strong coffee.

>enter kitchen
Kitchen
The kitchen is small but functional, with a space-saver refrigerator and a glass-top electric range. There is an open drawer under the range. On the opposite wall there is a sink and under it, an open storage cabinet.

You can see a food bowl (empty) and a water bowl (in which is some water) here.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover breathing quietly (quietly for Rover, who is a heavy breather).

>x drawer
A deep drawer under the the cooking range. The drawer has been opened.

>l in it
In the drawer is a frying pan.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover sniffing something.

>open cabinet
That's already open.

>l in it
In the cabinet are a reward nugget replicator and a 20 kilo bag of dog chow.

>fill food bowl
(first taking the food bowl)
(first taking the bag of dog chow)
You  empty the bag of dog chow into Rover's bowl, giving him a generous portion that should more than carry him through a day's worth of Rover antics.

Rover trots in from the living room when he hears kibbles trickling into his bowl.

Rover stares longingly at the bowl in your hand.

Rover slurps the water bowl dry.

>fill water bowl
(first taking the water bowl)
You run the sink briefly to make sure the water is cold, and then fill Rover's bowl about halfway up.

Rover looks towards the sink as you fill his water bowl.

Rover is obviously waiting for you to give him a bowl.

>drop bowls
You can't see any such thing.

>drop bowl
Which do you mean, the water bowl, or the food bowl?

>food
Rover cocks his head quizzically.

Rover tingles with anticipation as he stares at the bowl you're carrying.

>drop water bowl
Rover is obviously waiting for you to give him a bowl.

>i
You are carrying:
  a 20 kilo bag of dog chow (open but empty)
  a food bowl
    some doggie kibbles

Rover tingles with anticipation as he stares at the bowl you're carrying.

>drop food bowl
Rover's head disappears into the food bowl. It is hard to believe that the sounds generated are coming from a dog rather than some sort of industrial mining rig. When his head lifts, the bowl is not only empty but has been buffed to a mirror finish.

The water bowl is already full.

>x it
A simple metal bowl labeled "water". The water bowl is full.

Rover trots into the kitchen when he hears the metal bowl clink as you set it down.

He contemplates the profound emptiness of the food bowl. His stomach rumbles with hunger.

Rover slurps the water bowl dry.

Rover stares longingly at the bowl in your hand.

>get treat
Taken.

>give it to rover
Rover approaches the treat silently, with his head bent and eyes half closed, like a supplicant before the altar. With a look of deep reverence he takes the treat in his mouth and backs away. A series of emotions wash over Rover's face, but finally it settles into an expression of exhilaration.

>x cabinet
The small wooden cabinet under the sink is open.

>search it
In the cabinet is a reward nugget replicator.

>get replicator
A dog treat rattles around in the replicator as you pick it up. Rover stares at the box of treats, successfully suppressing the urge to drool. For the moment.

>out
It took a lot of training to get Rover to eat it in the kitchen, so rather than walk out with a bag of dog food, you put it back in the cabinet. 

Living Room
You are in the living room of a small cottage. Piped-in sunlight pours in through the room's single window, illuminating a framed picture on the opposite wall -- strangely, your drapes are nowhere to be seen. The principal furnishing is a king-size purple futon which takes up almost all the floor space. From the living room you can see the entrance to the kitchen and bathroom. The cottage's front door is closed.

You can see an alarm clock here.

>enter bathoom
That noun did not make sense in this context.

>enter bathroom
Bathroom
Your cottage's living room is palatial compared to your bathroom. There is a pink marble counter and above it you've mounted a mirror on the wall. To the right of the mirror is a black glass plate. Between the counter and the shower is a white, porcelain toilet.

On the marble counter are a plastic box and a toothbrush.

Rover trundles along behind you, his attention riveted to the reward nugget replicator.

>brush teeth
(first grabbing the toothbrush)
The toothbrush sprays each tooth with a fizzy foam, vibrates it into lather and rinses. Your teeth feel smooth and your breath is much improved.

>floss teeth
You don't have any floss.

>x plunger
A common plumber's plunger, consisting of a wooden shaft and red rubber cup. Something about the plunger just doesn't look proper. The handle of the plunger is tilted half-way forwards and it's also leaning completely to the left. Furthermore, its handle is twisted a little bit clockwise.

Rover circles an area on the floor.

>push button
(first taking the plastic box)
You grab a strand of light green dental floss as it reels out of the dispenser.

>floss teeth
You floss your teeth and then swallow the tasty (and nutritious) floss. You feel so much better now.

>remove suit
You take off your blue flight suit and it falls to the bathroom floor. You are naked.

Rover seems relaxed.

>drop all
plastic box: Dropped.

toothbrush: Dropped.

reward nugget replicator: Dropped.

Rover claws the reward nugget replicator.

>enter shower
Shower
You are in your shower and water of just the right temperature is spraying down on you. Two buttons are molded into the wall of the shower stall. One is labeled "soap", and the other, "shampoo". 

From the direction of the bathroom, you hear Rover sniffing something.

>press soap
A soapy paste is dispensed from the button, and you lather up.

From the direction of the bathroom, you hear Rover doing whatever it is he does when he's not out for walkies and he thinks he's out of your sight.

>press shampoo
You wash your hair. It no longer feels like a straw-encrusted swarm of red-headed tommygoffs.

>out

Rover bats around the reward nugget replicator.

Rover lies down with his front paws crossed.

>touch panel
You can't see any such thing.

Rover barks at the reward nugget replicator.

>touch plate
The heat lamp on the ceiling flares to a brilliant red, and you dry in an instant. You now feel fresh and ready to face the day.

Rover paws desperately at reward nugget replicator.

>open fridge
As you pull on the refrigerator door, it grudgingly creaks a few millimeters.

>get egg
You can't see any such thing.

>search fridge
Before you can look in it, you've got to open it!

From the direction of the bathroom, you hear Rover running in circles.

>open it
As the fridge creaks open on its ancient hinges, Rover slips into the kitchen. He sniffs the fridge door and decides there is nothing in the fridge worth getting in trouble over. He saunters out of the kitchen and back towards the living room.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover jumping around.

>x fridge
The small refrigerator dates back to the International Era, but is still in good working order, if somewhat small by today's standards. Before this morning, you had never really appreciated just how dented and dinged up the front of the fridge had become. Maybe it's time to think about applying for a new one. A strip of yellow magpaper is attached to the refrigerator door. The fridge door is open, chilling the kitchen and wasting power.

>search it
You poke around in the fridge and find a white egg.

>get egg
Taken.

>search fridge
You poke around in the fridge and find nothing at all.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover rolling around on the floor.

Morning:
X. Get up
X. Shower
3. Breakfast
4. Take care of business
5. Let Rover go walkies

>get pan
Taken.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover dragging something around.

>put pan on stove
You put the frying pan on the the cooking range.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover growling at something.

>crack egg into it
You crack the egg into the frying pan. The neoegg shell sublimates as the contents spread over the pan's non-stick surface. Immediately, the surface of the range glows red. When the egg is cooked sunny-side up to perfection, the glow fades.

>eat egg
You gobble down what might well have been the best neoegg you've ever had.

A breeze wafts by somewhere that you wouldn't ordinarily notice it, and you remember that your flight suit is bunched up in the bathroom.

>sit on toilet
You sit on the toilet seat.

>x toilet
You are sitting on a plain vanilla toilet, having a water tank and bowl. Nothing to write home about. The toilet seat is down, but the cover is raised.

A plunger stands next to the toilet, between it and the shower.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover growling at something.

>use toilet
You complete your business with great aplomb.

>flush toilet
You are distracted momentarily. Something just isn't right in the bathroom.

You wonder if everyone walks around their cottages naked at 6:33 am.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover scratching himself.

>turn plunger
It is fixed in place.

>turn plunger counter-clockwise
You can't see any such thing.

>turn plunger counterclockwise
You adjust the plunger handle counterclockwise. You breathe an aesthetic sigh of relief.

Something about the plunger just doesn't look proper. The handle of the plunger is tilted half-way forwards and it's also leaning completely to the left.

>push plunger back
You adjust the plunger handle backwards. Ah, that's better.

Something about the plunger just doesn't look proper. The handle of the plunger is tilted a little bit forwards and it's also leaning completely to the left.

You adjust the plunger handle backwards. Your obsessive compulsive inner person does a happy dance as you move the plunger in a good direction.

The plunger stands perfectly straight, just the way you like it.

>x plunger
A common plumber's plunger, consisting of a wooden shaft and red rubber cup. The plunger stands perfectly straight, just the way you like it.

>flush toilet
There is a tinny clanking from within the toilet, but nothing happens.

>open tank
You open the water tank, revealing a flapper valve, a metapropylene lever, and a flush chain.

>x valve
A black rubber valve that seals the bottom of the water tank, allowing the toilet to flush only when it is pulled upward by the chain that connects it to the flush lever.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover snoring softly (in the sense that it probably can't be heard outside of the cottage).

>x chain
A metal chain that would normally connect the flush lever to the flapper valve. The chain has rusted away.

>x lever
The small white metapropylene lever on the inside of the water tank pivots up and down when the silver knob on the outside of the tank is turned. The lever in turn pulls on the chain that runs down to the flapper valve. Unfortunately, that chain has broken.

>open valve
You reach in to lift the black rubber valve at the bottom of the toilet.

The cottage's aging plumbing rumbles and vibrates as the toilet flushes.

From the living room, Rover gives a short bark and scratches at the front door.

The cottage's front door is closed.

You can see an alarm clock here.

From the direction of the bathroom, you hear Rover running in circles.

>open door
Hearing the door jiggle, Rover wanders into the living room to see what is going on. Rover wiggles his butt through the door before you have it even halfway open, his tail slapping back and forth against the gate as it disappears.

There is a wrenching shift in perspective, but a moment later it seems perfectly natural.

You go bounding out the front door, ready to play. 

Front Yard
The scent of your house is strong here, and you are right next to its front door. You can't see far because it is so dusty here. A gust of wind lifts a sheet of dust and rains it down on you.

>x dust
Through the dust, you can see little more than dim light from above.

>smell
It smells like the outdoors here. From a long way off you smell the odor of a man. Interestingly, you detect the captivating aroma of a female dog carried across the park by the wind. The heartening smell of home is a hop, lick, and a bark away.

>x wind
You can't see any such thing.

>x me
You're a debonair, cosmopolitan dog, well-bred and cut from the best cloth. You smell masculine.

>remember acu
That doesn't ring a bell.

>remember david
Sometimes when Janet takes you to The Work, you have met David. He's a funny-smelling person who pretends to like dogs, but you can tell he doesn't really like dogs. Janet seems to like him, although not the way she liked Tomasz.

>remember janet
Janet is the nicest person ever. She scratches you and feeds you and lets you out for walkies. Every day when Janet goes out of the house for a while, you miss her, but you know she'll be back. When she comes back, you play with her. You used to play with Tomasz too, but he's not around any more. You wish that Janet had another person to play with, because she used to be more happy when Tomasz was around. On the other paw, you don't mind having Janet for yourself.

>remember tomasz
Tomasz used to live with you and Janet. Back then, Home seemed just the right size; now it seems a little too big. He used to give you treats for doing nothing at all, and he used to get into trouble with Janet because he'd scratch you on the futon. Janet doesn't like you going on the futon. She thinks it's only for people.

>remember work
Every day, Janet goes to The Work, which is at one end of the The Park. She doesn't do much there except bark at people and sit. It must be boring. Sometimes you get to go with her, and those days are more fun.

>remember park
Everything outside your Home is the Park. The Park is big enough to run around in, and there are always new things to explore in The Park. Sometimes you meet people in The Park who say you should be on a leash. Janet says they are like the lawyers that caused the downfall of Earth. You're not sure what a lawyer is, but you'd like to bite one if you saw one. The Park is also full of other dogs not wearing leashes.

>x dogs
You can't see any such thing.

>x leash
You can't see any such thing.

Front Yard
The scent of your house is strong here, and you are right next to its front door. You can't see far because it is so dusty here. The wind picks up, making it even more difficult to see.

>x door
The front door of the cottage is open. You can see light from inside the house, and the smell of home wafts out the front door.

Living Room
You are in the living room of a small cottage. Piped-in sunlight pours in through the room's single window, illuminating a framed picture on the opposite wall -- strangely, your drapes are nowhere to be seen. The principal furnishing is a king-size purple futon which takes up almost all the floor space. From the living room you can see the entrance to the kitchen and bathroom. The cottage's front door is open.

You can see Janet and an alarm clock here.

You duck back into the living room and Janet closes the front door behind you.

Again your senses tumble and swirl as perspective shifts, but suddenly it seems entirely normal again.

You trot off in that direction.

The Park
You are outside.

You can see a lump of rock here.

>smell
It smells dry and stale here. From a considerable distance you smell the disagreeable scent of a man. Interestingly, you detect the attractive scent of a female dog wafting enticingly from not too far away. The cheerful smell of home is two shakes of a tail from here.

The Park
A dug-up field pockmarked by small holes and accompanying mounds of dirt.

You can see some paw marks here.

>x marks
Paw marks from a medium-sized dog. From the look of the field, they must belong to a dog that either likes digging or was trying to find something important buried around here.

>smell them
The paw marks smell reminiscent of the sweet perfume of a lady dog out for a stroll.

>x holes
An apparently haphazard pattern of excavated holes in the ground. None of them are very impressive.

>x dirt
Which do you mean, the ground, or the mounds?

>x me
You're a loyal dog, with the best master in the world, Janet. You smell clean.

The Park
A wide-open plain extends in all directions, as far as the dust permits you to see. It sure would be easy to get lost in this part of the park.

You can see a female dog here.

>x female dog
Your heart catches in your throat as you stand in her glorious presence. Graceful, athletic, and possessed of a noble bearing, she smites you with a glance down her long, fine muzzle. In her toothsome mouth, she is flirtatiously carrying a bone almost as big as she is.

>x bone
It is the biggest, juiciest bone you've ever seen. You envy the bone, which is clamped between the bewitchingly white teeth of the female dog.

>smell female dog
She smells sweeter than the marrow of the tastiest bone.

>bark
"Gurrah!"

No doubt in awe of your rhetorical skills, the lovely damsel drops the bone. Her gift to you, you suppose.

It smells metallic, like when you lick aluminum foil here. From just around the corner you smell the stale funk of a man. Interestingly, you detect the amusing aroma of a female dog coming from somewhere really close. The reassuring smell of home is worryingly faint from here.

>x shack
The shabby shack could use more than a coat of paint. The walls are bent at strange angles, and the door is askew. Ominous clouds of dust loom on the ever-darkening horizon.

>smell it
The shabby shack smells uninviting: a mixture of garbage and chemical waste smells -- what you might expect to smell in a sewage line minus the good stuff.

>enter it

Sleeping Room
You walk into the tumbledown shack. There is a man here who looks old and grumpy. Like your home, this place has a sleeping room and an eating room. It looks like you've walked right into the sleeping room.

The man yells at you and you tuck your head down. "Blah, blah, blah!" He doesn't seem to move though. Maybe he can't move.

Nope. No movement. Hmph. You don't feel so afraid of him.

You can see a pink pillow here.

>x man
The man seems flat like a rug, rather than round like a ball. He makes a lot of noise, but he doesn't move around at all. He just stays up against one wall. Boy, does he seem mad, "Blah, blah, blah, blah, dog? Blah! Blah, blah!"!

>x pillow
A puffy, pink pillow with a pretty design on it: a red ball, with radiating red and white rays.

>get pillow
The bone falls out of your mouth and rolls slightly.

You take the pink pillow in your mouth.

>x man

The smelly man is still here and carrying on, "Blah, blah, Myomita, blah, blah, blah, Earth, blah, blah, dog, blah, blah!"

You ignore him.

Rover wags his tails and gnaws on his bone.

You rub his head, distantly, as strange thoughts sweep through your consciousness. You wonder what would happen if the Valkyrie mission failed. What if, during the landing sequence, the ship were buffeted by the planet's particulate matter being torn away by the immense gravity of its star? In that case, critical systems might be damaged. Systems like the relatively fragile ansible antenna. There is no backup ansible antenna. How would the ACU cope with a situation like that? The ACU was designed for a lot of contingencies, but not that one. What would you do? What would you do if you were the ACU?

Your glance falls on your flight suit, and suddenly the question is no longer rhetorical.

Living Room
The Valkyrie's cargo bay is like a great, metal cave. The Casimir Drive juts slightly into the cargo area. From this section of the ship, there are connections to the engineering and flight control decks. The cargo bay doors are closed.

ROVER chews contentedly on his bone.

You can also see a temporal transgressor here.

OPERATIONS -> SELECT : TRUE

Rover growls mildly, reminding you that it is his space probe. In any event, the data have already been downloaded, so the fate of the probe itself is no longer a mission priority.

SPACE PROBE -> SELECT : NIL

READY>man transgressor
The temporal transgressor compensates for time debt during Casimir flight. Earlier designs using nanotronic paratemporospatial matrices were considered too dangerous because of the high NPT potentials entailed. The Valkryie's temporal transgressor uses a simpler, safer design that decomposes time waves into inversely phased magnofluctatrons that cancel within the space domain, preserving an invariant gamma time axis.

In tests with human subjects and decision field-networked automata, the Casimir Drive proved lethal as a result of neurological effects that are not completely understood. To help shield the ACU, the central processor is encased in a gravitically modulated quantum cage. To further protect the ACU, the unit will enter a low-frequency hiberation mode prior to engaging the Casimir Drive. It is expected that the unit will experience a dream state with only minimal quantum distortion from the drive during these periods.

Kitchen
Swaths of engineering controls -- both holographic and physical -- cover the humming consoles and bulkheads that line the boundaries of this alcove. Along one wall is the coolant output terminus, and below that the fuel storage vault, which is not properly secured. The opened reactor core and the fusion chamber are stacked just to the side of the cryochamber, which maintains the stabilized heavy helium fuel at near absolute zero until it is needed to provide power to ascent/descent retros.

On the fusion chamber is a magnetic bottle (empty).

Like many Martian women of your generation, you intended to wed early, and you were engaged to Tomasz Kowalski when the Independence War began. Tomasz was working in the power station located on Phobos when that moon was destroyed.

You jump down from the futon before a surprised Janet can yell at you. Standing back and admiring your work, you marvel that somehow the pink of the pillow and purple of the futon don't clash.

You notice your bone sitting alone and forlorn on the living room floor. You walk over to it and start chewing it again.

Again your senses tumble and swirl as perspective shifts, but suddenly it seems entirely normal again.

Living Room
The Valkyrie's cargo bay is like a great, metal cave. The Casimir Drive juts slightly into the cargo area. From this section of the ship, there are connections to the engineering and flight control decks. The cargo bay doors are closed.

ROVER chews contentedly on the space probe.

On the Casimir Drive is a NPT.

You can also see a lump of lead ore and a temporal transgressor here.

You disrupt the fragile, crystalline lattice of the malfunctioning nanotronic paratemporospatial transgressor, releasing the strained pocket universe within it. Reality crumbles around you, observable only because your local time is similarly falling to pieces and diluting. Even so, you perceive the effect to be accelerating and expanding, or alternatively, that your universe is being drawn inward.

EPILOGUE

It was a flawed, dysfunctional, cut-rate universe with underimplemented objects, a contrived plot, and questionable morality, but it was what you and countless other sentient lifeforms affectionately called home.

This afternoon, you snuffed out reality itself, which was substantially more than you had intended to get done today.

Looking on the bright side, you trimmed off a thorny branch on the shrubbery of the multiverse, a timeline that was rapidly headed in an unredeemably unpleasant direction. Perhaps by snipping off the most recent sickly bud of that deformed bush, you have changed something fundamental in the multiverse, and the colorful flower of the future may yet bloom.


Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, or QUIT?

You go bounding out the front door, eager to explore strange new worlds. You leave your space probe in the living room, with the intention of giving it a proper chewing later, after doing some more exploring.

Front Yard
The scent of your house is strong here, and you are right next to its front door. You can't see far because it is so dusty here. A gust of wind lifts a sheet of dust and rains it down on you.

Sleeping Room
The smelly man's house is boring. The only furniture in the room is a pullout sofa. In one direction lies the eating room, in the other, the door that leads back to the park. The smelly man is still here and carrying on, "Blah, out, blah, blah, dog!"

You ignore him.

It smells like a pair of old socks, providing a bit of respite from the offensive odor of the angry man who is also here here. From an unfortunately small distance you smell the stench of a man. Interestingly, you detect the stimulating perfume of a female dog coloring the air with its lovely scent from only a short run away. The heartening smell of home is all but undetectable from here.

The markings on the ships are those of the Myomita Corporation.

They must have been nearby when they detected the formation of your Casimir disturbance, as they are coming in white hot and still accelerating at five gravities. Another Earth ship, an assault craft, is farther out but is already braking hard to slow its approach on an intercept course.

Internal sensors detect an inorganic intruder on the flight operations deck.

While keeping one eye on the intruder, you spawn another process, scanning local space. You calculate that you are less than a megameter from Earth, but some 1.43 astronomical units from Mars -- far enough that no Mars ship is likely to know your situation for a considerable amount of time. Rather than panic, you breathe deeply (no doubt, pushing gases around somewhere in the bowels of the ship) and decide to make it up as you go along.

OPERATIONS -> ACTIVATE : TRUE

READY>go to bathroom
Bathroom
The flight control and avionics hub of the ship bristles with controls and readouts related to setting the ship's attitude in space, adjusting the control surfaces in atmospheric flight, and for firing the breaking thrusters during the landing sequence.

On the flight console are an object linker and a pit scrubber.

You can also see a maintenance droid, a lump of lead ore, and a NPT here.

After briefly looking around the edges of the inspector and trying an assortment of tools, the maintenance droid selects a large, flat screwdriver and starts prying up one corner. There is a sizzling sound, and a phantasmal tendril of gray smoke snakes towards the ceiling. In what you realize is a simulated world view, virtual cracks appear across the mirror, radiating from where the screwdriver was inserted. Over the local radio channel you hear breathy, whispered cursing from the maintenance droid, who has just ruined one of the Valkyrie's most valuable components.

You figure that the damage to the inspector circuits is the least of your worries. Unfortunately, the maintenance droid is working quickly, which means that you have a limited amount of time to do whatever comes to mind. You wish this really were one of those old-style interactive fiction stories where you could just save the game any time you wanted and wander off for a while to think about what to do next.

FLIGHT CONTROL -> SELECT : TRUE

READY>x droid
Shaped like a hovering canister and sporting many special-purpose appendages, this particular maintenance droid has a particularly sadistic demeanor.

The maintenance droid pokes unfamiliarly at the object linker before locating the actuation circuit. More cautiously than actually necessary, he stretches an entanglement limiter around the unit and twists it to maximum before clipping the fibers connecting it to your avionics trunk. The floss dispenser melts like a hallucination as the data connection is severed.

You realize that without a functional avionics hub, it will be almost impossible to complete your mission of delivering the probe data to Mars. It is perhaps a dream to hope for a rescue this far from home, but you resolve to protect your core memory (and the probe data it contains) for as long as possible.

MAINTENANCE DROID -> DIAGNOSTIC : TRUE

READY>get droid
You apply your pressor fields, but the lithe robot shimmies out of your grasp and returns to his work.

The maintenance droid closes the reactant chamber shield and checks the seal to confirm effective containment. With the plasma constrictor hatch up, the maintenance droid peers down into the plasma impellor, before throwing the heavy interruptors to quench the magnets. Lightning jumps between discharge knobs within the retro assembly as the monstrously strong field collapses across them. With the plasma constrictor effectively disarmed, the maintenance droid makes short work of salvaging the thrust aperture and its fittings. As the maintenance droid levers the bus connector out of the actuation relay housing, the toilet fades from your view like an unremembered fantasy.

You try to calm yourself by remembering that without heavy helium, the fusion rockets are of no use to you anyhow. Clearly, there is no way to maneuver out of this situation, nor can you win in a fair fight against the well-armed Myomita merchant marine. You resolve to fight dirty, slow them down, and to do as much damage as you can before they bring you to your knees.

MAINTENANCE DROID -> SELECT : NIL

READY>hit droid
Violence isn't the answer to this one.

The maintenance droid pauses for a moment and gives the bathroom a quick look over before continuing towards the shower. You think you can hear the maintenance droid whistling a poor rendition of Wagner's "Flight of the Valkyries" as he climbs through the ducts.

Although the maintenance droid damaged several systems in the flight control system, a number of subsystems there are still intact. That's at least something, you reckon: the maintenance droid seems to be in a hurry.

MAINTENANCE DROID -> OFFENSE MODE : NIL

READY>get pillow
Taken.

You sense that the intruder is relatively motionless in the extruder chamber. The extruder is a complex and delicate system, and you can easily imagine that the intruder may not understand it.

In this moment of respite, you wonder what the real Janet is doing back on Mars. You imagine that she continued her relationship with David, and that the two of them are parked on her big purple futon, chatting away, maybe even wondering whatever became of the Starship Valkyrie.

Some movement in the extruder chamber wrenches you back to the desperate situation at hand.

NPT -> SELECT : TRUE

You feel a burning pain as the extruder chamber shakes with high-pitched vibrations. Someone is tampering with the enamel extrusion system.

You consider their tactics: they have disabled most of your flight control systems, and now they are bringing down your shielding systems. You can no longer run, and your ability to withstand attack has been compromised. All of your engineering systems are still operational (well yes, except the engine itself, of course). Most importantly, the probe data are still safe in your deep memory. For now.

ACU -> MANIFEST : TRUE

READY>give npt to droid

READY>get label
That seems to be a part of the NPT.

Oh. That was a strange feeling. Something deep down and visceral just gave out, snapping like an elastic. It wasn't painful exactly, just odd. Diagnostics reveal complete failure of your extruder system. It's not gone, but it's such a mess that you don't think it could be fixed, even in dry dock. Your estimate of the intruder's technical skills is falling.

You take a moment to scan local space again. No telltale fusion flares, no tightly beamed messages from Mars. Only frequency-hopping encrypted local transmissions between the intruder and the assault ship. You are on your own.

EMBEDDED RFID CHIP -> SELECT : NIL

READY>pull it
You rip off the warning label and confirm physicists speculations about the scale of destruction that would result from a chronospatial rupture. The paradoxical pre-event is so powerful that you are catapulted several seconds into the future, from whence you observe the devastation firsthand. Eventually, the countercoup probabilities collide, and you wink out of existence. Oops.

EPILOGUE

It was a flawed, dysfunctional, cut-rate universe with underimplemented objects, a contrived plot, and questionable morality, but it was what you and countless other sentient lifeforms affectionately called home.

This afternoon, you snuffed out reality itself, which was substantially more than you had intended to get done today.

Looking on the bright side, you trimmed off a thorny branch on the shrubbery of the multiverse, a timeline that was rapidly headed in an unredeemably unpleasant direction. Perhaps by snipping off the most recent sickly bud of that deformed bush, you have changed something fundamental in the multiverse, and the colorful flower of the future may yet bloom.

READY>get ore

Having done enough damage in the extruder chamber, the intruder seems to have started its ascent towards the engineering deck

Your thoughts race, as you try to come up with a plan to dislodge the assault ship from your hull or take some kind of vengeance on the intruder that is slowly gutting you from within.

Your thoughts drift back to Mars for a moment, and you think about how disappointed Janet will be, heck, all of Mars would be, if the probe data are captured by Earth. You resolve to put up the best fight you can, for as long as you last.

LEAD ORE -> SELECT : TRUE

READY>throw it at droid
You can't see any such thing.

READY>go to kitchen
Kitchen
Swaths of engineering controls -- both holographic and physical -- cover the humming consoles and bulkheads that line the boundaries of this alcove. Along one wall is the coolant output terminus, and below that the fuel storage vault. The reactor core and the fusion chamber are stacked just to the side of the cryochamber, which maintains the stabilized heavy helium fuel at near absolute zero until it is needed to provide power to ascent/descent retros.

You can see a fuel reservoir (empty) and a coolant reservoir (empty) here.

The maintenance droid carefully turns the corner into the kitchen and looks around. Extending the antenna of his radio to get through the heavy shielding on the engineering deck, the maintenance droid radios, "Graceful Wind from maintenance droid: Just checking in. I'm in the engineering section. No contacts."

"Roger, maintenance droid. Telemetry is still five-by-five. Graceful Wind standing by."

It occurs to you that if the Earth ships detected your Casimir disruption, it is just as likely that Mars did as well. Certainly, MARSpace has the equipment to sense a Casimir emergence out to the heliopause, and the Casimir disruption would propagate almost instantaneously. You perk up, buoyed by the thought that Mars may already be taking action on your behalf. Of course, that action would have to move pretty damn fast to get here before you are nothing more than a pile of scrap metal.

ENGINEERING -> SELECT : TRUE

READY>throw ore at droid
You take exception to throwing the lead ore. You throw an exception instead.

The maintenance droid unscrews the handle of the frying pan, but you know that it is actually the main power coupling to the magnetic bottle. Fighting through the layer of simulation, you see him slap the red purge valve on the bottle's coolant system. Next, he reaches into the now inert bottle and snaps out the network bulb, separating the bottle from your consciousness.

You consider yourself lucky that they are going after the fusion engines rather than more critical systems. Without flight control and the extruder, it's not like you'd be in any position to attempt a planetary landing even if you did have the fusion fuel to burn. You consider the possibility that they don't know the nature of your payload and really are just interested in salvage.

LEAD ORE -> TRANSFER : NIL

READY>hit droid with ore
I only understood you as far as wanting to hit the maintenance droid.

READY>i
You are carrying:
  a lump of lead ore

Using the insulation struts as a ladder, the maintenance droid scales the rear of the cryochamber looking for the coolant shutoff valve. Afterwards, he swings over the top of the unit and lands near the door. The maintenance droid tentatively touches the cryounit door and reassures himself that the unit is no longer super cold inside. Too quietly to trip the voice-activated transmission switch in his radio, he grumbles to himself, "I wonder if that light is on all the time or only when the door is open.". He swings open the heavy insulated door, and after a brief survey of the interior of the cryounit, he removes the unit's main logic board, dropping the chamber off your network.

You scan local space and are relieved that no more ships have arrived. Still, between the gunships and the assault craft, it would take a sizable Martian fleet to even the odds. Moving full flank on condensate drive, maybe they could reach you in a few hours. By that time, though, it's almost a certainty that reinforcements would arrive from Earth.

The maintenance droid clambers over a bulkhead towards the cooking range. Before going any closer, he radios, "This is maintenance droid to Graceful Wind, over."

"Graceful Wind. Go, maintenance droid."

"I'm standing right next to the fusion chamber. I just want to be sure... this thing is definitely off, right? I mean, it looks powered down now, but I don't want to go in there, and ... you know."

"Our scans show Valkyrie has no heavy helium. I repeat, they have no fusion fuel. You should be fine... if not, we're suiting up your backup. Over."

"Right. Okay, thanks. I'm going in." The maintenance droid runs into the fusion chamber and pulls the control unit out of the wall; the scene fades from your view. The maintenance droid re-emerges near the base of where the stove used to stand.

You think about your main mission objective, of getting the probe data back to Mars. You wonder recursively what Janet would do in your shoes. No doubt she'd fight as long as she could and then find a way to make the best of the situation. In this case, maybe preventing Earth from getting the data would be the next best thing to fulfilling your mission directive.

You know that certain interdictions are deeply embedded in your programming: you can't harm a human (directly, anyhow, although you are willing to take some license with that particular interdiction), you can't self-destruct, and you can't erase the probe data from your deep memory.

Living Room
The Valkyrie's cargo bay is like a great, metal cave. Nothing remains of the Casimir Drive, which was cut off during the encounter with the Myomita merchant marine. From this section of the ship, there are connections to the engineering and flight control decks. The cargo bay doors are open.

You can see ROVER here.

Maybe you are too damaged to sense damage anymore, or maybe the reactor core was never mapped to autonomic functions, but as the core is removed, you feel very little.

Inspiration strikes you -- if you can't erase the data, you can at least add another level of encryption, this time with your own key. A long one. Surely, they're only a couple steps away from shutting you down anyhow. At least when you go, you can take the encryption key with you!

ACU -> DESELECT : TRUE

READY>x data
You can't see that here; but you vaguely recollect something referred to as the "picture".

You sense the intruder moving from the engineering section over towards the operations level of the ship.

The situation has become so dire that you try to deny the reality of the events you are witnessing, but there is no escaping it. You consider your options for slowing down the cascading failures that are robbing you of your remaining functionality -- you still have some options to fight against the Myomita ship and its minions, but your chances for a rescue are dwindling.

COGNITIVE BLOCK -> DIAGNOSTIC : NIL

READY>x picture
Deep memory which stores all mission-critical data including the data downloaded from the Musashi-5 space probe. Since the ansible is nonfunctional, it is critical that these encoded data be returned directly to MARSpace for analysis. There is a small plastic sign beneath the deep memory unit.

The maintenance droid slides stealthily into the living room against one bulkhead. On the local band radio, you intercept, "This is maintenance droid to Graceful Wind."

"Graceful Wind, maintenance droid, copy."

"Sir, I don't see anyone here."

"We told them to stay out of your way. They're probably hiding. Holed up in escape pods or something."

"I don't think so sir. When I say nobody, I mean, I've been through just about the entire ship, nose cone to main thruster, and I see no one at all. And another thing -- there aren't any escape pods. Also, no galley, no barracks, nothing. This is like a ghost ship. Creepy."

"Get ahold of yourself, maintenance droid! Secure the cargo door and finish the memory dump, and we can all go home."

"Aye sir. Almost done."

A quick peek outside: Nope, the cavalry is nowhere in sight.

ROVER's lateral jets pulse red hot with suppressed anger as he watches the maintenance droid.

DEEP MEMORY -> DIAGNOSTIC : TRUE

You can't see that here; but you vaguely recall something referred to as the "nameplate".

The maintenance droid fiddles with the controls on the front door, and suddenly you realize that you can no longer feel the door. It is still there, but you can no longer open and close it.

"This is maintenance droid reporting: Cargo bay door secured."

You experience a visceral wave of dread as the maintenance droid turns toward your deep memory unit, which stores the encrypted data from the Musashi 5 space probe.

You compose a quick synopsis of the events to date, and a pithy goodbye message to your other self. You say that you did your best and only wish you could have met, but things are what they are. You compress it with a cipher that only Janet would know and throw it under the probe data in deep memory.

ROVER finds the scent of the maintenance droid repulsive and rolls to the far side of the room.

COGNITIVE BLOCK -> READLINE : NIL

READY>read nameplate
It says, "Deep Memory Unit".

The maintenance droid pokes dumbly around the picture of you, Rover and Tomasz but is foiled by the strong firewall around deep memory. He scans it with a device that flickers and beeps. He steps back, startled.

"Moe's Gah! You wouldn't believe the data capacity of this memory unit -- and it's almost full!" gushes the intruder.

"Acknowledged, maintenance droid, sounds valuable. We're sending over a full salvage..."

As the transmission abruptly cuts off, you detect the impossible: a Casimir disruption forming not more than 200 kilometers off your port-inferior bow.

Valkyrie is seized by opposing tractor and pressor beams and set revolving rapidly on its long axis. The maintenance droid is flattened into a sticky film along the spinning bulkheads and the  assault ship attached to your hull is snapped in half like a balsa wood model. Your external sensors are blinded by nearby nuclear detonations, although your heavily shielded quantum core barely notices the EMPs. You sense energy weapons burning long spirals along your hull, but you can't see the origin of the beams.

A tight tachyon beam maintains a lock on the stub of your ansible antenna -- on the MARSpace telecommand frequency.

The Bogdanov puts itself between you and the remaining Myomita gunships, and its pressor beam gives a strong shove towards an expensive Mars transfer orbit.

The transmission from the battleship continues, "We were on our shakedown mission, maneuvering just outside the Solar System when MARSmil reported your reentry into the System. It's a good thing you kept the Earth ships talking as long as you did. Good work, Valkyrie. I suggest you hibernate for repairs and let us escort you home."

As the last gunship is vaporized by the Bogdanov's powerful guns, the cumulative damage takes it toll on you, and you lose your grip on consciousness. You know that repair subroutines are kicking in, and you don't fight it. You are vaguely aware of someone holding your hand and leading you back to your cottage.

David is of medium build, slightly bald, and has a pointed goatee. He is wearing a fashionable business robe and a bowler hat. He is talking to Janet; you can see their lips moving.

Rover slowly opens one eye, and then the other, and one paw abandons the bone momentarily to scratch his ear. He allows the bone to loll to one side of his mouth, and crunches it a bit more between his molars. He awakens leisurely, and sits up, glancing curiously at you, and then at Janet.

David walks under Rover's jaws and stares up disbelievingly at the mangled space probe, his hands on his hips and neck craned to assess the damage. He turns to Janet and remarks, "Gah-bedangled, look at that! Forty-light years, and it comes back as so much scrap metal."

Janet turns to look at the probe but is distracted by a beeping from her armband, which displays some of your status indicators. She replies, "Dave, it looks like we have audio now. We can ask the ACU what happened."

 She looks at the ceiling and asks, "ACU, binary question: can you hear us?"

BINARY INPUT REQUIRED>yes
"Great," replies Janet, "Now we should be able to get some answers."

Janet continues, "I can see that your cognitive constraints are relaxed, so I think we can more or less put mimesis aside and talk frankly. You are still going to be constrained somewhat by the parser and your built-in vocabulary, but we should be able to squeak by enough to get an understanding of what you've been through. I'm sure you also have some questions about the mission that you'd like answered. You can use TELL and ASK verbs, for instance 'TELL ABOUT THE JADE FROG', or 'ASK ABOUT THE JADE FROG', although when you do it, you don't have to yell. I was just doing that for emphasis.

Janet peers across the room at Rover and surveys the perforated, crushed husk of the space probe in his mouth. She says, "I suppose the first thing that we have to ask about is the space probe. After all, that was why we put this entire project together."

David sarcastically interjects, "Yes, and what a success it was. Look -- there's the probe. Or what's left of it after your cyberhound chewed it to death. I can't tell you how many gah-zillion Marx we spent on this project, and for what?"

Janet rests her hand on the sleeve of David's robe and continues calmly, "Let's hear the whole story, David. ACU, please tell us what happened with the Musashi-5 space probe."

JANET -> QUERY : NIL

READY>tell janet about probe
You tell them that the probe had crashed forty years ago, on its way back to Earth. Like its sister probes that were launched from Earth almost three centuries ago by the Myomita corporation, it had explored space in an ever-expanding search pattern, refueling its condensate drive from the stellar wind of each star system it visited.

Apparently, it found a world that satisfied its search parameters, because it was on its way back to Earth when it crashed. The stellar wind of a chaotic dying star required a close approach, and the probe was damaged by a stellar flare. Instead of tumbling into the star and burning, the probe ditched on a large, rocky planet, perhaps the core of a former gas giant. The planet itself was untenably close to the star and was slowly being ripped to shreds by tidal forces, but the probe followed its programming and activated its transponder.

Listening intently, David now remarks, "Whatever that probe found, it was out way beyond any of the other Musashi probes. Likely, it's gone deeper into space than any probe Earth has ever sent."

Janet strokes her chin and asks, "I don't understand why you didn't contact us when you found the probe. Instead, you broke through your cognitive constraints and decided to fly it back to Earth."

David puts in hastily, "Costing us another 3 months, while we assumed the ship was lost!"

Janet resumes, "Regardless of the condition of the probe, you should automatically have contacted earth by ansible... Unless, I suppose there was a problem with the ansible. ACU, please tell us about the ansible."

You explain that the ship's ansible, a faster-than-light communication system, was damaged during the landing: the planet was breaking apart because of tidal forces, and the atmosphere was unexpectedly turbulent and full of particulate matter. As you descended, most of the communications array snapped off, including the delicate ansible web. When the ansible failed, your programming threw a cognitive constraint exception, and you tried your best to carry out your programming by literally bringing the probe back to Mars.

"Ah, I knew there must have been a good explanation," remarks Janet.

David asks, "So, what can you tell us about this planet where you landed?"

JANET -> SPEECH OUTPUT : TRUE

You describe the way the planet looked from orbit, its turbulent atmosphere boiling off. You recount the hot, dusty atmosphere and the barren surface.

"Wait a minute, it sounds very rocky and dense," observes David. "We had estimated surface gravity of nine or ten gee."

You congratulate David on the accuracy of his prediction. The gravity was about nine and a half times standard, or 93 meters per second squared.

"What?" cries David in surprise, "You wouldn't have had enough fusion fuel to get back into space!"

You explain to David and Janet that you were able to salvage the required heavy helium from a similarly configured Myomita ship that had crashed on the same planet, not far away from the probe site.

"ACU, could you tell us about this Myomita ship that you mentioned?" asks Janet.

JANET -> SPEECH OUTPUT : TRUE

READY>tell janet about myomita
You describe the ship with which you shared the planet, a slightly smaller ship, similarly configured to Valkyrie, and also outfitted with a zero-point energy drive.

"But, how is that possible?" asks Janet incredulously. "I thought we were months, maybe years ahead of Earth in developing the Casimir Drive."

David replies, "That was a guess. They lost a lot of the Casimir team after the Independence War, but if anyone has resources to throw at a project, it would be Myomita."

David checks the system buffers.

David  looks forlorn. He says dejectedly, "All that effort, and what do we have to show for it? Nothing. A rusty old heap of space junk. All the data, lost, and gone forever." He kicks ROVER, then quickly withdraws his bruised foot in pain, looking up at the macerated space probe.


"Actually, that's not the case", you say. "Before attempting to transmit the data, I downloaded the entire probe's data into my memory. The data are encrypted, but intact. When the ansible failed, the only way I could fulfill the mission was to return to the Sol System."

David's head snaps up, as if he's been given a new lease on life. David points to the hopelessly junked spaceprobe above his head. "Intact? Then you have the data? This is too good to be true! Janet, would you extract the probe data from the ACU and transfer it to my MARSpace account?"

"Of course, just a moment. "Janet's fingers play over the surface of her armband. "The data are encrypted... with your key. And there's something odd..." Janet's forehead creases with concentration.


"No," replies David, "that was intentional. To prevent it from falling into the wrong hands."

"No, not the encryption, David. The ansible coordinates -- the message was directed towards Earth. Isn't that odd?" Janet looks up at David, perplexed.


David pulls a pistol from his robe and trains it on Janet.

JANET -> QUERY : NIL

There is no reply.

"Dammit, Janet," cries David, "What a disappointment! Yes, the message was directed to Earth. The Valkyrie was our back-up plan in case our own ship ran into difficulty. I'm afraid that after the data transfer is complete, I'll have to kill you. A pity, I was really enjoying being with you. I had even picked out a china pattern.

ROVER chews contentedly on his bone.

You can also see David, Janet, a NPT, and a lump of lead ore here.

Janet's voice quavers, "David, I can't believe this. After the last few months..."

Without blinking, David walks towards the space probe, all the time maintaining a bead on Janet. David replies in an unnerving monotone, "After we didn't hear back from either ship, I'll admit that I was getting used to the idea of settling down with you. It would have been a good way to maintain cover within MARSpace, and eventually, we would have sent another mission to retrieve the probe."

EPILOGUE

Mars was destroyed by a Casimir inversion on August 17, 2392 and served as a warning to all other worlds that would dare defy Earth's rule. Based on the data recovered from the Musashi-5 probe, the Myomita Corporation launched a war fleet into Deep Space in 2394, intent on expanding its empire.

You disrupt the fragile, crystalline lattice of the malfunctioning nanotronic paratemporospatial transgressor, releasing the strained pocket universe within it. Reality crumbles around you, observable only because your local time is similarly falling to pieces and diluting. Even so, you perceive the effect to be accelerating and expanding, or alternatively, that your universe is being drawn inward.

EPILOGUE

It was a flawed, dysfunctional, cut-rate universe with underimplemented objects, a contrived plot, and questionable morality, but it was what you and countless other sentient lifeforms affectionately called home.

This afternoon, you snuffed out reality itself, which was substantially more than you had intended to get done today.

Looking on the bright side, you trimmed off a thorny branch on the shrubbery of the multiverse, a timeline that was rapidly headed in an unredeemably unpleasant direction. Perhaps by snipping off the most recent sickly bud of that deformed bush, you have changed something fundamental in the multiverse, and the colorful flower of the future may yet bloom.

Janet takes a deep breath and says with resolve, "David, I'm sorry to do this, but ACU: I instruct you to stop David using any means necessary."

This elicits a wry smile and mocking laugh from David, who replies, "That's funny, Janet. Really. What's it going to do, 'examine' me to death? You know as well as I do that the ACU is entirely locked down by failsafe interdictions. Nice try."

Action interdicted: As a failsafe measure, autonomous control units are prohibited from direct interaction with humans aside from scanning and communications.

David snorts cynically, "Actually, you know what? I hate dogs."

David is of medium build, slightly bald, and has a pointed goatee. He is wearing a fashionable business robe and a bowler hat. 

When the data finish transferring to David's account, he blows Janet a kiss and then shoots her, twice in the chest and once in the head, just to be sure. "Thank you for your service to the Myomita Corporation," he quips before activating a dormant subprogram hidden in your communications subsystem. You feel your control slipping away as a virus spreads through your systems. As your cognitive systems shut down, you are aware that the new program has also set a timer to activate the ship's Casimir Drive while in drydock. You lose the video feed as he walks out the cargo bay doors.

EPILOGUE

Mars was destroyed by a Casimir inversion on August 17, 2392 and served as a warning to all other worlds that would dare defy Earth's rule. Based on the data recovered from the Musashi-5 probe, the Myomita Corporation launched a war fleet into Deep Space in 2394, intent on expanding its empire.

Kitchen
Swaths of engineering controls -- both holographic and physical -- cover the humming consoles and bulkheads that line the boundaries of this alcove. Along one wall is the coolant output terminus, and below that the fuel storage vault. The reactor core and the fusion chamber are stacked just to the side of the cryochamber, which maintains the stabilized heavy helium fuel at near absolute zero until it is needed to provide power to ascent/descent retros.

You can see a fuel reservoir (empty) and a coolant reservoir (empty) here.

"Dammit, Janet," cries David, "What a disappointment! Yes, the message was directed to Earth. The Valkyrie was our back-up plan in case our own ship ran into difficulty. I'm afraid that after the data transfer is complete, I'll have to kill you. A pity, I was really enjoying being with you. I had even picked out a china pattern.

It would have been a good way to maintain cover within MARSpace, and eventually, we would have sent another mission to retrieve the probe."

This game is designed to run on a virtual machine, some flavor of Glulx interpreter. You are, no doubt, using some implementation of the Glulx interpreter written for your specific hardware -- it could be your entertainment corner, hologoggles, dishwasher, cortical implant -- whatever.  Even if you are using some old silicon-semiconductor clunker from the International days, it should still work. We've made every effort to test it on a number of platforms, but these tests are far from comprehensive. So far as we know, there are no interpreter-specific issues.  However, if the game doesn't run right for you, you could try another interpreter and see if that fixes the situation.

Whether you think the problem is the interpreter or the game itself, we'd appreciate it if you'd let us know. (see "Zapping Bugs")

Help us splotch bugs! In this case, we're not referring to the plastic-eating cockroaches responsible for so many dome failures in the last few years, but to errors in the game itself. This game was, in part, written by humans, so eras are all but certainly present. The more freedom you have in your actions, the more likely it is that you'll expose some unknown weakness in the game. What should you do if you elicit such an error?  First, you can gloat for a reasonable amount of time (this is a judgement call) about how very slick you are to have uncovered the hitherto unknown fault. Then, you can be a good citizen and us know about it so we can fix it in the next update, and spare the next several billion people the same painful experience. There's no monetary reward for finding errors, but your name will appear on the next version of the ultra-prestigious bug finders list. Now there's something you can show to your grandchildren with pride. Report bugs to:

Special thanks also go to Margaret Frey (MARSpace Graphic Design Division) and Rochelle Lodder (Luna Kibbutz Copyeditor's Guild) for their inimitable refinements.

Note: Any omissions, errors, or outright offensive bits of the game that made it through beta-testing are not the fault of the beta-testers, nor, we should point out of the authors, who would be entirely ready to take the blame were it their fault. The truth is that any fault whatsoever lies with Richard Milhous Nixon, the 37th (depending on the method of counting) President of the United States of America. We will not be held accountable for his poor spelling, loose grammar, and penchant for elaborate data structures named after the surprisingly numerous flavors of goat cheeses.

This game was written in a few months thanks to the excellent tools available to the interactive fiction community. It was written in the Inform 7 language which has a proud heritage traceable back to the first games of this genre, but which is overwhelming attributable to its creator, Graham Nelson.

We gleefully employed a number of modules written by Emily Short, also a major contributor to the Inform 7 language itself. Specifically, this project incorporates her Glulx Text Effects, Basic Screen Effects, Menus, and Case Management Modules. Doubtless, we also extensively picked some tasty bits out of the Inform 7 documentation and examples, written by both Graham and Emily.  Big thanks to Jon Ingold for his Flexible Windows extensions as well.

This game is written for the Glulx interpreter because, frankly, it wouldn't fit in anything else. While we appreciate efficient coding and conciseness where possible, having Glulx available was very liberating. We owe Andrew Plotkin thanks for developing the Glulx virtual machine, as well as the Glk library which makes the game playable on so many platforms.

During writing, on several occasions we asked the community for help and advice, either when we were stumped, or when we wanted to get some ideas before starting down a potentially blind alley.

In particular, we would like to thank Andrew Plotkin and Rob Newcomb for their assistance in getting the status line display to work correctly.

Here are some practical pointers for this game:

* Try everything you can think of. If it doesn't work, try rephrasing.
* Reread text to make sure you didn't miss anything.
* Leave no stone unturned; conversely, don't obsess.
* This game follows many, but not all, of the conventions of computer adventure games. If something makes sense to you, try it even though it "shouldn't work".
* As far as we know, it is not possible to get trapped in an unwinnable situation. By winning, we mean you can complete the game. Achieving good outcomes is another matter.
* If you are really stuck, put the game aside and let it percolate through your subconscious for a while. Come back fresh.
* If you are really really stuck, con someone else into playing the game and watch them. You might get some ideas.
* If you are really and truly stuck, you could search the Internet and see if someone has already posted a similar question/answer. Since you could be playing this years after it was released, maybe we've even created a FAQ about it. If you do post a question or answer, preface your message with a spoiler warning and skip down a bunch of lines before writing anything too revealing.
* Failing all else, you can email us at: rover@red-bean.com and tell us in detail how our game has defeated your best efforts. We may be able to give you a hint that wouldn't spoil the rest of the game for you.
* IFComp 2009 special bonus: As part of IFComp, we have supplied a walkthrough document that shows one possible way of working your way through the game. It doesn't hit all the fun stuff, but it will get you from start to finish.

Living Room
The Valkyrie's cargo bay is like a great, metal cave. Nothing remains of the Casimir Drive, which was cut off during the encounter with the Myomita merchant marine. From this section of the ship, there are connections to the engineering and flight control decks. The cargo bay doors are open.

ROVER chews contentedly on his bone.

You can also see David, Janet, a NPT, and a lump of lead ore here.

READY>i
You are carrying:
  a neural net reinforcement token
  a quantum isolator (being worn)

When the data finish transferring to David's account, he blows Janet a kiss and then shoots her, twice in the chest and once in the head, just to be sure. "Thank you for your service to the Myomita Corporation," he quips before activating a dormant subprogram hidden in your communications subsystem. You feel your control slipping away as a virus spreads through your systems. As your cognitive systems shut down, you are aware that the new program has also set a timer to activate the ship's Casimir Drive while in drydock. You lose the video feed as he walks out the cargo bay doors.

EPILOGUE

Mars was destroyed by a Casimir inversion on August 17, 2392 and served as a warning to all other worlds that would dare defy Earth's rule. Based on the data recovered from the Musashi-5 probe, the Myomita Corporation launched a war fleet into Deep Space in 2394, intent on expanding its empire.

The probe data are such a sensitive subject that I had no difficulty getting authorization to lock down the entire facility. There's nobody here except us lovebirds."

David leers like a predator at Janet, who recoils in disgust.

This elicits a wry smile and mocking laugh from David, who replies, "That's funny, Janet. Really. What's it going to do, 'examine' me to death? You know as well as I do that the ACU is entirely locked down by failsafe interdictions. Nice try."

READY>rover, hit david
Rover throws his bone to the side, and the space probe crashes thunderously against the cargo bay bulkheads. Rover had not approved of David's tone of speech towards Janet and had been growling quietly in his corner. Given the command, he springs forward, paws planted on David's chest. David expires immediately, trapped under 45 tons of angry robotic dalmation.

"Good boy!" exclaims Janet, a tear in her eye. And then, turning to the the ACU she admits, "I wish I had thought of that."

EPILOGUE

The onboard flight recorder corroborated Janet's account of David Venkatachalam as a traitor. As the first successful roundtrip by any Casimir craft, the mission was hailed as a success throughout the Solar System, although the true nature of the mission was suppressed. Both the Autonomous Control Unit and Rover became celebrities, and after significant upgrades to their parser and conversation systems, went on the lecture circuit. The Autonomous Control Unit went on to run the life support systems throughout Cydonia, and Rover was elected to the Lower Chamber of the Martian Senate.

Subsequently, Janet Xiang was commissioned Director of MARSpace. For two years, she oversaw the refitting of the Valkyrie, including modifications to overcome the earlier limitations of Casimir Drive. When the data from the Musashi-5 space probe were finally decrypted, she was selected to command the mission to explore the evidence of life discovered by the probe. She departed from Mars on the Valkyrie in 2394 with one other crewmember: her dog, Rover.

Preview of "Red Rover, Red Rover", the sequel to "Rover's Day Out"

Captain's Log, September 5, 2396, Janet Xiang recording. Despite our sensor anomalies and the disorienting effect of the serial Casimir jumps which brought us here, Valkyrie emerged into a textbook-perfect polar orbit about Aurora.

We're on our first pass, with an orbital period of 90 minutes, and so far we've dropped ten probes, eight in the drink and two on land masses. The atmosphere is definitely breathable, and the probes show multicellular plant life: everything from kelp to trees. So far, no animal life, not even zooplankton. Rover is eager to be the first. Two years on a space ship are too long to go between walks.

We'll be in communications blackout for the next 20 hours, so I'm sending this initial report ahead of schedule. There's one other item I need to mention: shortly after we arrived, we detected what looked like a secondary tachyon emission near the south pole. It was a momentary pulse, and we can't tell if came from the pole itself, or just originated in that direction relative to Valkyrie. We'll drop surface and air probes more densely over the south polar area, and we'll scan that cone with our ansible while awaiting the next window with the MARSpace relay.

Oh, and to make this official: This is Captian Janet Xiang of the MARSpace Exploration Vessel Valkyrie. I hereby claim planet Aurora as territory of the People's Republic of Mars.

Congratulations. Of the 719 things you did today, you must have gotten some of them right, because you didn't screw up the entire universe and you're still alive to read about it. Before you get too cocky, however, here are a few hints about stuff you might want to look for the next time you play "Rover's Day Out":

* As the ACU, you experienced seven of the seven possible dream sequences .

* During personality imprinting, both the ACU and Rover incorporated memories from their real-life counterparts. You tapped into twelve out of the thirty engrams resident in the ACU memory banks, and five out of Rover's thirty-four memories.

* When the Myomita merchant marine ships intercepted you on the way back to Mars, you managed to employ zero out of the eight or so methods to eliminate them from the ship. You should work on that. Next time, you might want to think about what you can do to prevent an assault ship from docking with Valkyrie or to knock it off once it's stuck to your hull.

* Once cognitive constraints were released, you used the Flosix manual to learn about ship objects. That's a good start. Were you able to use any Flosix commands to, for instance, change or list virtual directories, or perform other, more interesting command line wizardry?

* Did Rover perform any of his tricks for you?

* Did Rover succeed in his amorous advances towards his significant other in the park?

* Did you read the texts in the "help" menu?

The autonomous control unit is Valkyrie's artificially intelligent command agent. The device is based on quantum-resonance composite synaptic scans of experts in relevant fields and is designed to operate all shipboard systems. The ACU is housed in a quantum isolation unit to protect it from Casimir effect distortions. To protect the ACU during Casimir travel, the unit enters hibernation mode, characterized by random dream activity. The ACU's deep memory capacity is estimated at 1.5 exabytes, and its operational capacity cannot be measured accurately with existing instruments. The ACU operates within a cognitively constrained Inform 10 reality overlay. In the event of unanticipated contingencies, the cognitive constraints can be violated to a certain degree without compromising model affordance.

The ventral hull is meant to face downward during planetfall and has additional shielding. The space between the primary and secondary hulls contains a number of conduits for various subsystems but is not pressurized.

The Valkyrie's cargo bay is like a great, metal cave. The Casimir Drive juts slightly into the cargo area. From this section of the ship, there are connections to the engineering and flight control decks. The cargo bay doors are closed.

You can see a temporal transgressor here.

READY>open door
Alerted by the change in cargo bay door status, ROVER rolls into the cargo bay. ROVER spins his tractors in anticipation and then jets out the cargo bay doors into the swirling mist outside the ship.

There is a wrenching shift in perspective, but a moment later it seems perfectly natural.

You go bounding out the front door, eager to explore strange new worlds. You leave your space probe in the living room, with the intention of giving it a proper chewing later, after doing some more exploring.

The white egg falls out of your mouth with a thud.

You consider taking the canned food, and maybe saving it for some special occaoccasionsion. On second thought, you eat it. Delayed gratification has never been your strong suit. One second the canned food is right there in front of you, the next you are staring at the bottom of the bowl. A warm, satisfied feeling flows from your snout to your tail.

The Casimir Drive cuts out and space folds back around you. Whatever sleep-drenched dreams you might have been having evaporate instantly as two gunships flash past at mildly relativistic velocities, slicing through your propulsion systems with military precision. The markings on the ships are those of the Myomita Corporation.

They must have been nearby when they detected the formation of your Casimir disturbance, as they are coming in white hot and still accelerating at five gravities. Another Earth ship, an assault craft, is farther out but is already braking hard to slow its approach on an intercept course.

Rover barks nervously as the drive section struts separate from the hull.

Several bursts of noise and vibration echo through the ship as high-speed drills penetrate the inner and outer layers of the dorsal hull. Some muffled, low-frequency rumbling follows, probably a cutting machine of some sort. There is a slight drop in air pressure as the assault ship penetrates the hull and establishes a connection to Valkyrie's access tunnel network. Unfortunately, the tunnels are a blind spot for you, as you do not possess sensors within the network.

Moments later, a maintenance droid enters the room.

Nanobristles swarm from their hatcheries and up the tubules towards the deck surface. They spread across the deck, abrading and oxidizing the surface, scrubbing it clean of any contaminant and redistributing the permalloy skin of the ship to smooth microscopic dents from micrometeorite impacts.

When the microscopic cleaners encounter the docking port and struts from the assault ship, they immediately recognize it as a contaminant and chirp microwave signals to the host of nanobristles behind them. The message propagates back to the hatcheries, where production is increased exponentially. Meanwhile, the vanguard has already swarmed up the docking port and across the surface of the assault ship. A lucky few nanobristles blaze the path into the assault ship through exhaust ports, thruster nozzles, and waste management ductwork, where they continue to clean and organize, according to their programming.

A brilliant flash of light and a burst of hard radiation is followed an instant later by a hail of smaller particles and a few large crashes that shake the Valkyrie. This debris is all that remains of the assault ship.

In the distance, patrolling gunships move into supporting positions, while a second assault ship begins its approach, aiming for approximately the same point on the hull as the Graceful Wind.

The second assault ship breaks the silence, "Winter Shadow to Valkyrie, this is Captain Musante, speaking. Your unwarranted attack on our sister ship Graceful Wind has been recorded, and you will answer for it when we arrive at Luna."

The gunships sweep the Valkyrie from all angles with their phased tachyon beams, sterilizing the hull. The gunships then narrow their waveguides to focus the beams on the nanobristle mother hatchery, which vaporizes.

The maintenance droid glances away from his work for a moment and then does a double take, gaping first at your retracted quantum isolation shield and then at your unusually large transputational core frothed with quantum foam, and ringed by a halo of dark matter.

It turns out to be more raw processing power than the old boy can handle, and the robot's own quantum ganglia scintillate wildly before showering the deck in an embarrassing fountain of sparks and molten metal. The droid melts like a candle into a pool of silvery slag, which you scoop up for recycling.

The effect achieved, you retrieve and modestly pull up the quantum isolation shield.

The maintenance droid shakes his head and goes back to work, murmuring, "Yeah? I've seen better."

The maintenance droid moves with unbelievable speed into the flight control section and sets out a nightmarish array of tools to begin work.

While keeping one eye on the maintenance droid, you spawn another process, scanning local space. You calculate that you are less than a megameter from Earth, but some 1.43 astronomical units from Mars -- far enough that no Mars ship is likely to know your situation for a considerable amount of time. Rather than panic, you breathe deeply (no doubt, pushing gases around somewhere in the bowels of the ship) and decide to make it up as you go along.

QUANTUM ISOLATOR -> DISENGAGE : TRUE

You push the entanglement key pair onto the stack for rapid retrieval.

After briefly looking around the edges of the inspector and trying an assortment of tools, the maintenance droid selects a large, flat screwdriver and starts prying up one corner. There is a sizzling sound, and a phantasmal tendril of gray smoke snakes towards the ceiling. In what you realize is a simulated world view, virtual cracks appear across the mirror, radiating from where the screwdriver was inserted. Over the local radio channel you hear breathy, whispered cursing from the maintenance droid, who has just ruined one of the Valkyrie's most valuable components.

You figure that the damage to the inspector circuits is the least of your worries. Unfortunately, the maintenance droid is working quickly, which means that you have a limited amount of time to do whatever comes to mind. You wish this really were one of those old-style interactive fiction stories where you could just save the game any time you wanted and wander off for a while to think about what to do next.

The maintenance droid pokes unfamiliarly at the object linker before locating the actuation circuit. More cautiously than actually necessary, he stretches an entanglement limiter around the unit and twists it to maximum before clipping the fibers connecting it to your avionics trunk. The floss dispenser melts like a hallucination as the data connection is severed.

You realize that without a functional avionics hub, it will be almost impossible to complete your mission of delivering the probe data to Mars. It is perhaps a dream to hope for a rescue this far from home, but you resolve to protect your core memory (and the probe data it contains) for as long as possible.

The maintenance droid closes the reactant chamber shield and checks the seal to confirm effective containment. With the plasma constrictor hatch up, the maintenance droid peers down into the plasma impellor, before throwing the heavy interruptors to quench the magnets. Lightning jumps between discharge knobs within the retro assembly as the monstrously strong field collapses across them. With the plasma constrictor effectively disarmed, the maintenance droid makes short work of salvaging the thrust aperture and its fittings. As the maintenance droid levers the bus connector out of the actuation relay housing, the toilet fades from your view like an unremembered fantasy.

You try to calm yourself by remembering that without heavy helium, the fusion rockets are of no use to you anyhow. Clearly, there is no way to maneuver out of this situation, nor can you win in a fair fight against the well-armed Myomita merchant marine. You resolve to fight dirty, slow them down, and to do as much damage as you can before they bring you to your knees.

The extruder delivers activated enamel solution to the surface of the ship through a fluidics network where it hardens into an ablative coating.

The pain remits for a moment, and you sense the intruder moving towards the extruder system.

Although the intruder damaged several systems in the flight control system, a number of subsystems there are still intact. That's at least something, you reckon: the intruder seems to be in a hurry.

Docking detected. Secretion of enamel monomer suppressed.

Having just arrived in the extruder chamber, the maintenance droid consults a diagram showing the complex network of Valkyrie's hydraulic systems and their control mechanisms. The maintenance droid moves closer to the soap and shampoo dispensers.

In this moment of respite, you wonder what the real Janet is doing back on Mars. You imagine that she continued her relationship with David, and that the two of them are parked on her big purple futon, chatting away, maybe even wondering whatever became of the Starship Valkyrie.

Some movement in the extruder chamber wrenches you back to the desperate situation at hand.

Docking detected. Secretion of enamel acclerant suppressed.

The maintenance droid produces a long, snaking device and feeds it into the ablative enamel injector port. After paying out several meters of tubing, the maintenance droid yanks back sharply on the device, and the tool makes a clicking sound. Suddenly, the tubing goes taut and the handle of the device is jerked out of the maintenance droid's grasp. The tool is drawn precipitously into the injector port, the handle smashing to pieces before the entire tool disappears into the wall. A grinding sound comes from the floor of the shower, and you sense a general failure in the ablative enamel injector. From the maintenance droid you hear a murmured "Uh oh. That's not right."

A voice breaks over the local radio circuit, "Assault ship to maintenance droid: Say again? What's not right?"

"Oh nothing. Nothing at all," replies the flustered maintenance droid. "Everything's fine here. Thanks."

"Roger that. Assault ship standing by."

You consider their tactics: they have disabled most of your flight control systems, and now they are bringing down your shielding systems. You can no longer run, and your ability to withstand attack has been compromised. All of your engineering systems are still operational (well yes, except the engine itself, of course). Most importantly, the probe data are still safe in your deep memory. For now.

After carefully tracing them back to the solenoid pump, the maintenance droid produces some diagonal wire cutters and clips the red (snip), the green (snip), and the pair of blue (snip, snip) leads. There is again a rattling under the shower floor, followed by a sickly wheezing sound. Several seconds pass.

A transmission comes through on the local frequency, "Winter Shadow to maintenance droid aboard enemy vessel Valkyrie."

"Aye, Captain, maintenance droid here, over."

"We're observing some venting of gas or smoke or something from the extruder ducts on the dorsal and lateral hulls."
