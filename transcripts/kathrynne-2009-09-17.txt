Rover draws pensively on his stubby cigar, the tip glowing red below his dealer's hat. He paws nonchalantly at the scotch and water he has been nursing for the last half hour. Despite the tower of chips in front of him, he's either in trouble now, or trying to play the rest of the table for suckers. His tail is no longer wagging, though, and you suspect that the scotch may be getting the better of him. He can't mass more than about 30 kilos, and he's been putting them away tonight. You push all in, figuring that even if you lose it all, at least you'll get some sleep before you need to get back to the MARSpace. Elva the cleaning lady folds, as does Isaac Asimov and that boy that you kissed in fourth grade. Wait...don't go....where is everyone going?

Bathroom
Your cottage's living room is palatial compared to your bathroom. There is a pink marble counter and above it you've mounted a mirror on the wall. To the right of the mirror is a black glass touch plate. Between the counter and the shower is a white, porcelain toilet.

On the marble counter are a plastic box and a toothbrush.

From the direction of the kitchen, you hear Rover barking at something.

>go kitchen
You are still dripping wet! Before you drench the floor of every room in the cottage, it would make sense to dry off.

>touch plate
You switch the black plate on.

Janet: Crap.
David: Windex?
Janet: It's the Myomita operating system. It's backwards compatible to the 20th century. Maybe earlier.
David: We can't use Windex as the substrate for the ACU -- it's too critical. Can it run under Flosix?
Janet: Yes, but it will take some time to install and debug.
David: I can help you, the rest of the ship is Flosix, stem to stern. I live and breathe Flosix.
Janet: Happy to have the help -- how about dinner first?
David: Do you like Thai?

Rover's Day Out
An Interactive Simulation by Janet Xiang
Release beta810 / Serial number 23920415 / Inform 10.6 build Mu-013 (I6/v.7.1 lib 7/18N)

Rover sniffs the air and tears away from the picnic blanket. You and Tomasz watch with surprise as he runs, for once, away from the food. Rover bounds over the hedges, howling wildly, and spooks a xihuahua which had been playing with a tiny red ball. The so-called "shaved rat" gulps an oversized portion of air, extends its membranous ears and flys across the park into the arms of a douty grey-haired woman with a cane. Rover picks up the ball triumphantly, ignoring the piercing wavetrain of yips and indignant scolding coming, respectively, from the xihuahua and its owner. Shaking her cane limply towards Rover, she admonishes in an a strong Earth accent "That mongrel should be on a leash!" Her own, unleashed, uncollared neodog stares accusingly from the safety of her arms, its distensible ribs alternately inflating and deflating like bellows. "Your kind is ruining Mars, ignoring every law, dissing your elders! You never lived on the surface, you never don't know what you've got!". You try to give the ball back to her, but she pushes it away in disgust, "Kids. Meh."


David: Hey, different dream sequence. Is it glitching?
Janet: No, the ACU's dreams are heavily influenced by power-up state of the processor and internal noise. Every time the ship dehibernates after a Casimir jump, it will experience some sort of dreaming. Some of them can be pretty bizarre.
David: Good, I'd hate to think that we wasted two weeks of programming.
Janet: I wouldn't say wasted.
David: Huh? I didn't mean us.
Janet: Cross your fingers and hope the whole thing doesn't crash again on the heat lamp.

<beep> <beep> <beep>

>wake
Gathering your resolve, you slowly slide off the side of the futon, inadvertantly sending the alarm clock on a death spiral off the edge of the futon. Oh well, you can find it later. Meanwhile, you slowly stand up, recapitulating millions of years of evolution in a few seconds.


David: Thank you. I can only take so many dream sequences.
Janet: No problem. So, at this point, the Valkyrie would be at the edge of the probe's stellar system, and ready to switch over from Casimir to condensate drive and begin the approach.

>fold futon
With a little effort, the futon folds up, snug against the wall, leaving more room to walk around the cramped cottage.

>undress
You take off your  flight suit and it falls to the living room floor. You are naked.


David: That mole should be on your left side.
Janet: Good eye for detail -- I'll flip the UV coordinates on the next run.

>go bathroom
It's too dark to move around much. Grues and all that, you know. 

As you are feeling your way around the futon, the beam of light coming in through the drapes catches you right in the eye and you are momentarily blinded.

>open drapes
You push aside the drapes.

Living Room
You are in the living room of a small cottage. Piped-in sunlight pours in through the room's single window, illuminating a framed picture on the opposite wall. The principal furnishing is a king-size purple futon which takes up almost all the floor space. From the living room you can see the entrance to the kitchen and bathroom. The cottage's front door is closed.

You can see a flight suit, an alarm clock, and Rover here.

>go bathroom
Bathroom
Your cottage's living room is palatial compared to your bathroom. There is a pink marble counter and above it you've mounted a mirror on the wall. To the right of the mirror is a black glass touch plate. Between the counter and the shower is a white, porcelain toilet.

On the marble counter are a plastic box and a toothbrush.


Janet: Let's hope the simulation doesn't crash again. I'd really like to run it all the way through to the Rover release.
David: It's looked good this far.

>brush teeth
(first grabbing the toothbrush)
The toothbrush sprays each tooth with a fizzy foam, vibrates it into lather and rinses. Your teeth feel smooth and your breath is much improved.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover running in circles.

>floss
You don't have any floss.

>get floss
You can't see any such thing.

>get box
Taken.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover jumping around.

>floss
You have the little plastic box that dispenses floss, but no actual dental floss.

>get in shower
The last time you walked out of the bathroom with your toothbrush, you never found it again. You toss it on the counter. The plastic box almost makes it out of the bathroom, but you remember to set it down before stepping out. 

Shower
You are in your shower and water of just the right temperature is raining down on you. Two buttons are molded into the wall of the shower stall. One is labeled "soap", and the other, "shampoo". 

>press soap button
A soapy paste is dispensed from the button, and you lather up.

David: That was my favorite part! Why did you rewrite it?
Janet: I thought it might be too distracting for the ACU.

>press shampoo
You wash your hair. It no longer feels like a straw-encrusted swarm of yellow-headed tommygoffs.

Janet: David, what's the ablative coating for? I thought that most of that planet's atmosphere had been cooked off long ago.
David: Not really my department. Maybe it's supposed to help with the heat.
Janet: I've heard temps up to 1000 Kelvin?
David: In that ballbark. They think the probe impacted on the star-facing side of the planet. Estimates put the surface temp there between 800 and 1200K.

>exit shower

Bathroom
Your cottage's living room is palatial compared to your bathroom. There is a pink marble counter and above it you've mounted a mirror on the wall. To the right of the mirror is a black glass touch plate. Between the counter and the shower is a white, porcelain toilet.

On the marble counter are a plastic box and a toothbrush.

>touch plate
The heat lamp on the ceiling flares to a brilliant red, and you dry in an instant. You now feel fresh and ready to face the day.

Janet: I was holding my breath there. Looks like our patch worked.
David: I had my fingers crossed too.

>go living room
Living Room
You are in the living room of a small cottage. Piped-in sunlight pours in through the room's single window, illuminating a framed picture on the opposite wall. The principal furnishing is a king-size purple futon which takes up almost all the floor space. From the living room you can see the entrance to the kitchen and bathroom. The cottage's front door is closed.

You can see a flight suit, an alarm clock, and Rover here.

>put on flightsuit
(first taking the flight suit)
You put on the flight suit.

>go kitchen
Kitchen
The kitchen is small but functional, with a space-saver refrigerator and a glass-top electric range. There is a drawer under the range. On the opposite wall there is a sink and under it, a storage cabinet.

You can see a water bowl (in which is some water) and a food bowl (empty) here.


David: Where are your coffee machine and toaster?
Janet: I mapped the ship functions to the minimum number of objects. More objects means more ways for things to go wrong and more time debugging. Call me lazy.
David: Lazy.
Janet: You don't know the crazy things that the ACU does! Sometimes it walks around trying to eat or take everything in sight. Sometimes it sings and jumps around. It's based on my neural bindings, but the ACU definitely has a mind of its own, and I don't want to have to worry about what it might try do with a toaster.

>sing
You quietly sing a short song that Tomasz had taught you. The song is about a lonely colony ship engineer who pines for his sweetheart back on Earth.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover rolling around on the floor.

>jump around
I only understood you as far as wanting to jump.

>open cabinet
You open the cabinet, revealing a reward nugget replicator and a 20 kilo bag of dog chow.

>get bag
Taken.

>l bag
In the 20 kilo bag of dog chow are some doggie kibbles.

>fill dog food bowl
(first taking the food bowl)
You  empty the bag of dog chow into Rover's bowl, giving him a generous portion that should more than carry him through a day's worth of Rover antics.

Rover trots in from the living room when he hears kibbles trinkling into his bowl.

Rover outright gapes at the bowl you carry, then gently sniffs it in hopes that you'll give it to him.

Rover drinks the water.

>save
Ok.

>give rover bowl
(Rover the food bowl)
Rover smacks his lips as you lay the bowl down for him.

Rover gulps down the food, without pausing for niceties such as breathing.

>get replicator
A dog treat rattles around in the replicator as you pick it up. Rover stares at the box of treats, successfully suppressing the urge to drool. For the moment.

>close cabinet
You close the cabinet.

>open fridge
Rover looks up when he hears the old fridge open. He sniffs the fridge door and decides there is nothing in the fridge worth getting in trouble over. He saunters out of the kitchen and back towards the living room.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover sniffing something.

>l in fridge
You poke around in the fridge and find a white egg.

>get egg
Taken.

>l egg
You find nothing of interest.

>x egg
A big white neoegg.

>l
Kitchen
The kitchen is small but functional, with a space-saver refrigerator and a glass-top electric range. The fridge door is not completely closed. There is a drawer under the range. On the opposite wall there is a sink and under it, a storage cabinet.

You can see a food bowl (empty) and a water bowl (empty) here.

>open drawer
You open the drawer, revealing a frying pan.

>get frying pan
Taken.

>put pan on stive
You can't see any such thing.

>put pan on stove
You put the frying pan on the the cooking range.

>save
Ok.

>fry egg
You wonder if the egg wouldn't cook better if you actually put it in the frying pan.

>put egg in pan
You put the white egg into the frying pan.

>fry egg
You crack the egg into the frying pan. The neoegg shell sublimates as the contents spread over the pan's non-stick surface. Immediately, the surface of the range glows red. When the egg is cooked sunny-side up to perfection, the glow fades.

Janet: If there were some heavy helium left after landing, could the ship take off again?
David: Hypothetically, yes, but the planet has essentially no atmosphere to break against and it has about nine times Earth gravity. Even with optimal approach we'll have to fuse every gram of that heavy helium to make a soft landing.
Janet: I just hate to leave the ship there. It could take years before our next Casimir ship will be built, and who knows if Valkyrie will survive that long on that chthonian rock.
David: Nice word. From MARSpace perspective, all that matters is that the probe data are recovered.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover snoring softly (in the sense that it probably can't be heard outside of the cottage).

>eat egg
You gobble down what might well have been the best neoegg you've ever had.

David: Wait a minute! She just scoops the egg out of the pan with her hand and eats it like a grizzly bear raking salmon out of a river?
Janet: Works for me, yeah.
David: How about a plate and fork?
Janet: The ACU doesn't miss them, and it's less programming overhead. And bonus: fewer dishes to clean.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover scratching something.

>wash pan
That's not a verb I recognize.

>put pan in sink
You're tired of stuff piling up in the sink, so you stick to your New Year's resolution and decide to hang on to the frying pan.

>go living room
It took a lot of training to get Rover to eat it in the kitchen, so rather than walk out with a bag of dog food, you put it back in the cabinet. 

Living Room
You are in the living room of a small cottage. Piped-in sunlight pours in through the room's single window, illuminating a framed picture on the opposite wall. The principal furnishing is a king-size purple futon which takes up almost all the floor space. From the living room you can see the entrance to the kitchen and bathroom. The cottage's front door is closed.

You can see Rover and an alarm clock here.

Rover watches you intently, concentrating on reward nugget replicator.

>examine alarm
It's a cheap, white plastic alarm clock with fading green LEDs that read 6:11 am.  A large button juts out of the top.

>get alarm
You pick up your beat up old alarm clock and put it back on the futon, so you can enjoy its lovely beeping tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow.

Rover sniffs the front door.

>find leash
That's not a verb I recognize.

>open door
If you open the front door, Rover will get all excited and expect to go walkies. Better get your morning routine out of the way first.

Rover walks around the room, occasionally sniffing various spots on the floor.

>go bathroom
Bathroom
Your cottage's living room is palatial compared to your bathroom. There is a pink marble counter and above it you've mounted a mirror on the wall. To the right of the mirror is a black glass touch plate. Between the counter and the shower is a white, porcelain toilet.

On the marble counter are a plastic box and a toothbrush.

Rover trundles along behind you, his attention riveted to the reward nugget replicator.


Janet: So now we begin the landing cycle. This is where the ACU really shines.
David: What about timing? The ship has to be in the right orientation and to fire the fusion thrusters at exactly the right time.
Janet: The ACU works so fast that no matter how many individual steps it takes, the effect occurs at the right time.

>put seat down
You weren't holding the toilet seat to begin with.

>lower seat
The toilet seat is already down.

Rover tucks his nose under his front paws.

>sit
Sit on what?

>sit on seat
You sit on the toilet seat.

>use toilet
You can do a lot of things in your one-piece flight suit. That ain't one of them.

>stand
You stand up again.

>go living room

The cottage's front door is closed.

On the purple futon is an alarm clock.

>undress
You take off your blue flight suit and it falls to the living room floor. You are naked.

>go bathroom

Your cottage's living room is palatial compared to your bathroom. There is a pink marble counter and above it you've mounted a mirror on the wall. To the right of the mirror is a black glass touch plate. Between the counter and the shower is a white, porcelain toilet.

On the marble counter are a plastic box and a toothbrush.

Rover trundles along behind you, his attention riveted to the reward nugget replicator.

>sit on seat
You sit on the toilet seat.

You wonder if everyone walks around their cottages naked at 6:24 am.

>ue toilet
That's not a verb I recognize.

>use toilet
You complete your business with great aplomb.

>stand
You stand up again, although you are uncomfortably aware that you have left some, shall we say, "unresolved" business behind you.

>flush
You are distracted momentarily. Something just isn't right in the bathroom.

>l
Bathroom
Your cottage's living room is palatial compared to your bathroom. There is a pink marble counter and above it you've mounted a mirror on the wall. To the right of the mirror is a black glass touch plate. Between the counter and the shower is a white, porcelain toilet.

On the marble counter are a plastic box and a toothbrush.

You can also see Rover here.

Rover walks towards the toilet.

>l toilet
There's something in it, but you don't want details.

>l in toilet
There's something in it, but you don't want details.

>flush
Before you do so, the plunger catches your attention.

>l plunger
There is nothing on the plunger.

Rover circles an area on the floor.

>l area
You can't see any such thing.

>flush
Maybe you've been reading too much Lovecraft, but the plunger next to the toilet seems to be somehow misshapen and twisted. Its suddenly alien geometry suggests to you that some inchoate force of primordial corruption is reaching from across the stars, gibbering and gyrating contemptibly in the half-formed chaos between the toilet and the shower. Or maybe the eldritch plunger is just tilted a bit.

>flush 
There's something odd about the plunger. You forget what you're doing for a moment.

>get plunger
Since the day Tomasz jammed the plunger down on the bathroom floor, it has been stuck there like a barbed harpoon in the side of a great whale. Well, maybe more like a giant squid on wrapped around an unfortunate whale, since squids have (you have heard) suckers. Some kind of weird interaction between the rubber cup and the micropores in the floor have effectively bonded the plunger to the floor, and any attempt to remove it would probably destroy one or the other. The plunger doesn't really bother you, and most of the time you just ignore it.

Rover wags his tail as if amused by some random thought.

>flush toilet
Something about the plunger next to the toilet disturbs your sense of order.

>GAH
That's not a verb I recognize.

>x plunger
A common plumber's plunger, consisting of a wooden shaft and red rubber cup. Something about the plunger is not right, though. The handle of the plunger is tilted strongly backwards and it's also leaning somewhat to the right. Furthermore, its handle is twisted just the tiniest little bit counterclockwise.


>hold handle
That seems to be a part of the plunger.

>push handle
The shaft is firmly attached to the red plunger cup which has been stuck to the floor since you were allocated the cottage. If you want to yank the handle in any particular direction, just say so.

>pull handle back
You adjust the plunger handle backwards. Something about the plunger is not right, though. The handle of the plunger is tilted almost completely backwards and it's also leaning somewhat to the right. Furthermore, its handle is twisted just the tiniest little bit counterclockwise.

>push handle left
You adjust the plunger handle leftwards. Something about the plunger is not right, though. The handle of the plunger is tilted almost completely backwards and it's also leaning a tad to the right. Furthermore, its handle is twisted just the tiniest little bit counterclockwise.

>push handle forwards
You adjust the plunger handle forwards. Something about the plunger is not right, though. The handle of the plunger is tilted strongly backwards and it's also leaning a tad to the right. Furthermore, its handle is twisted just the tiniest little bit counterclockwise.

Rover looks at the marble counter.

>twist handle clockwise
You adjust the plunger handle clockwise. Something about the plunger is not right, though. The handle of the plunger is tilted strongly backwards and it's also leaning a tad to the right.

Rover cocks his head and ogles the marble counter.

>push handle forward
You adjust the plunger handle forwards. Something about the plunger is not right, though. The handle of the plunger is tilted somewhat backwards and it's also leaning a tad to the right.

>push handle forward
You adjust the plunger handle forwards. Something about the plunger is not right, though. The handle of the plunger is tilted a tad backwards and it's also leaning a tad to the right.

>push handle forward
You adjust the plunger handle forwards. Something about the plunger is not right, though. The handle of the plunger is tilted just the tiniest little bit backwards and it's also leaning a tad to the right.

>push handle forward
You adjust the plunger handle forwards. Something about the plunger is not right, though. The handle of the plunger is leaning a tad to the right.

>push handle left
You adjust the plunger handle leftwards. Something about the plunger is not right, though. The handle of the plunger is leaning just the tiniest little bit to the right.

>push handle left
You adjust the plunger handle leftwards. The plunger stands perfectly straight, just the way you like it.

>flush
The cottage's aging plumbing rumbles and vibrates as the toilet flushes.


David: That's it. One long burn down to the planet's surface.
Janet: And then, the ACU just needs to deploy the Rover.

Rover runs out of the bathroom, and you hear him jumping around hear the front door.

>go living room
Living Room
You are in the living room of a small cottage. Piped-in sunlight pours in through the room's single window, illuminating a framed picture on the opposite wall. The principal furnishing is a king-size purple futon which takes up almost all the floor space. From the living room you can see the entrance to the kitchen and bathroom. The cottage's front door is closed.

On the purple futon is an alarm clock.

You can also see Rover and a flight suit here.

Rover lays down, rolls over, and barks, hoping to persuade you to toss him a treat.


Janet: When Rover brings the probe back to the ship, it will automatically extract the data and send it back by ansible. Did you enter the ansible parameters?
David: Yes, I had to do it manually since the frequency and coordinates are encrypted. It's too bad they didn't have FTL communications when they built the probes - it would have saved us the trip.
Janet: Yes, but then Earth would get the information as well -- even encrypted, I wouldn't want it to fall into their hands.

>give rover treat
(Rover the dog treat)
(first taking the dog treat)
Rover nearly takes your hand off in rush to swallow the treat. A series of emotions wash over Rover's face, but finally it settles into an expression of euphoria.

>put on suit
(first taking the flight suit)
You put on the flight suit.

Rover dashes back and forth like a possessed dog for no apparent reason.

>open door
Rover looks up when he hears the door begin to open. Rover slips out the door.


Janet: So, that's it. Rover goes out, gets the probe, brings it back to the ship, and then the information is squirted back to MARSpace.
David: Well, congratulations, Doctor Xiang, on a job well done. I say we celebrate tonight, and get up early for the launch tomorrow morning.
Janet: It's a deal. Give me ten minutes to make the final commit, and I'll join you.
David: I'll put the champagne on ice.

An Interactive Simulation by Janet Xiang and David Venkatachalam
Release 1 / Serial number 23920416 / Inform 10.6 build Mu-013 (I6/v.7.1 lib 7/18N)

Even mildly drugged and reclining on an overstuffed couch in the MARSpace human resources office, it's hard to relax in the presence of the MARSpace political officer conducting the final interview. You didn't catch her name, probably because she never mentioned it. After three such interviews and six months of background check, what more could they want?  

"Ms. Xiang, thank you for your cooperation. Your tests show no hint of disloyalty to the Republic or MARSpace. We hope you understand the need for these measures, particularly for personnel with access to the Valkyrie's command and control functions. Now that you are cleared, I can inform you that credible sources have warned that the project may have been infiltrated by..."

<BEEP> <BEEP> <BEEP>

You weren't particularly enjoying this dream, but being jarred awake by a violently shaking futon is even less pleasurable.

As the bed bucks and tumbles, several scenarios flash through your mind: explosive decompression of the dome? Volcanic activity? Meteor impact? Before you can even consider your next action, you are thrown from the futon onto the living room floor. Light pours in from the window. It looks like the drapes were somehow torn away from the window.
