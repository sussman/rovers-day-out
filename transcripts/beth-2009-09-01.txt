Rover's Day Out
An Interactive Fiction by Janet Xiang
Release beta 732 / Serial number 23920401 / Inform 10.6 build Mu-013 
(I6/v.7.1 lib 7/18N)

Rover draws pensively on his stubby cigar, the tip glowing red below his 
dealer's hat. He paws nonchalantly at the scotch and water he has been 
nursing for the last half hour. Despite the tower of chips in front of 
him, he's either in trouble now, or trying to play the rest of the table 
for suckers. His tail is no longer wagging, though, and you suspect that 
the scotch may be getting the better of him. He can't mass more than about 
30 kilos, and he's been putting them away tonight. You push all in, 
figuring that even if you lose it all, at least you'll get some sleep 
before you need to get back to the MARSpace. Elva the cleaning lady folds, 
as does Isaac Asimov and that boy that you kissed in fourth grade. 
Wait...don't go....where is everyone going?


David: You have some weird dreams.
Janet: You can't hold me responsible for the subconscious ramblings of the 
ACU.

<beep> <beep> <beep>

>
I beg your pardon?

>hello
That's not a verb I recognize.

>answer
Confident that your neighbors won't hear a thing through the cottages's 
excellent sound insulation, you let loose with a primal scream.

<beep> <beep> <beep>

>answer phone
(to Rover)
First things first, you're still in bed.

<beep> <beep> <beep>

>look
Alarm clock. Next to bed. Make it stop.

<beep> <beep> <beep>

>turn off alarm
In your early morning stupor, you squeeze the alarm clock like a water 
melon pit, sending it even nearer to the edge of the bed and incidentally 
hitting the snooze button.

The alarm clock rolls into a ball, and flies the length of the vehicle 
construction facility, chased by an eager, slobbering dalmation. In the 
Martian gravity, Rover bounds three meters into the air and sails over the 
heads of an annoyed crew in cleanroom suits working frantically on the 
main fusion rocket heavy-helium regulator. The mission director, David 
Venkatachalam, grimaces, but your mother offers you a comforting cup of 
tea.


David: The ACU certainly has that dog on its mind.
Janet: Well, I do think about Rover a lot. Besides, the Rover is central 
to the mission, so a lot of the code is dedicated to the Rover.
David: I don't really make that expression do I? I looked pouty.
Janet: All the time, but I like the word "petulant" better than "pouty".
David: I'll stick with pouty.

Must wake up. Eyes blurry.

<beep> <beep> <beep>

>open eyes

<beep> <beep> <beep>

>wake up
Gathering your resolve, you slowly slide off the side of the futon, 
inadvertantly sending the alarm clock on a death spiral off the edge of 
the futon. Oh well, you can find it later. Meanwhile, you slowly stand up, 
recapitulating millions of years of evolution in a few seconds.


David: Thank you. I can only take so many dream sequences.
Janet: No problem. So, at this point, the Valkyrie would be at the edge of 
the probe's stellar system, and ready to switch over from casimir to 
condensate drive and begin the approach.

As you get out of bed, you notice that your left arm is numb -- must have 
been the way you were sleeping.

>look arm
Which do you mean, the left arm, or the right arm?

>look left arm
You find nothing of interest.

You left arm feels strange. Maybe a little bit numb.

>flex fingers
That's not a verb I recognize.

>wiggle left arm
That's not a verb I recognize.

>move left arm
Nothing obvious happens.

>move left arm fingers
You can't see any such thing.

>hit left arm
Violence isn't the answer to this one.

>look
Living Room
Where the heavy drapes meet, a sliver of sunlight shines into the 
otherwise dark living room. A framed picture hangs on the living room wall 
in the small area illuminated by the shaft of light.

>open drapes
You push aside the drapes.

Living Room
You are in the living room of a small cottage. Piped-in sunlight pours in 
through the room's single window, illuminating a framed picture on the 
wall. The principle furnishing is a king-size purple futon which takes up 
almost all the floor space. From the living room you can see the entrance 
to the kitchen and bathroom. The cottage's front door is closed.

You can see Rover here.

>look picture
You find nothing of interest.

>enter kitchen
You can't really move around much because of the futon. It takes up a lot 
of room.

David: Isn't that a tad inconvenient?
Janet: Yeah, but it kind of made sense when I got it.

>fold up futon
With a little effort, the futon folds up, snug against the wall, leaving 
more room to walk around the cramped cottage.

>enter kitchen
The Kitchen
The kitchen is small but functional, with a space-saver refrigerator and a 
glass-top electric range. There is a drawer under the range. On the 
opposite wall there is a sink and under it, a storage cabinet.

You can see a water bowl (empty) and a food bowl (empty) here.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover scratching himself.

>fill water bowl
(first taking the water bowl)
You run the sink briefly to make sure the water is cold, and then fill 
Rover's bowl about half way up.

Rover wanders into the kitchen when he hears water splashing into his 
bowl.

>open fridge
Rover looks up when he hears the old fridge open. He pokes his nose in the 
fridge and sniffs around, although he knows full well that stuff in the 
fridge is for people only and that he'd be in a heap of trouble if he got 
too curious in there.

Your left arm feels fat and numb.

>look in fridge
You poke around in the fridge and find a white egg.

Rover narrows his eyes critically, noting the lack of food in his food 
bowl. He looks at the food bowl. He looks at you. He looks at the food 
bowl. He looks at you.

>close fridge
You close the old fridge.

>look left arm
You find nothing of interest.

>view left arm
That's not a verb I recognize.

>look drawer
You can't see inside, since the drawer is closed.

Your left arm is bothering you.

Rover notices the lack of food in his soi-disant food bowl. His stomach 
rumbles with hunger.

>open drawer
You open the drawer, revealing a frying pan.

Rover contemplates the profound emptiness of the food bowl. He looks at 
you with imploring puppy dog eyes and then back again at his empty food 
bowl.

>remove frying pan
(first taking the frying pan)
You're not wearing that.

Rover appears lost in thought.

>take frying pan
You already have that.

Rover sighs audibly and frowns at his food bowl. He paws pathetically at 
the food bowl, and the hollow, tin ring of the pitiful bowl echoes through 
the kitchen.

>put frying pan on stove
You put the frying pan on the the cooking range.

It feels like a swarm of spiders is running up and down your left arm, 
tickling you.

>crack egg into pan
You can't see any such thing.

>put egg in pan
You can't see any such thing.

>put egg in frying pan

The Kitchen
The kitchen is small but functional, with a space-saver refrigerator and a 
glass-top electric range. There is an open drawer under the range. On the 
opposite wall there is a sink and under it, a storage cabinet.

On the the cooking range is a frying pan (empty).

You can also see Rover and a food bowl (empty) here.

Rover circles an area on the floor.

>close drawer
You close the drawer.

Your left arm feels fat and numb.

Rover narrows his eyes critically, noting the lack of food in his food 
bowl. He paws pathetically at the food bowl, and the hollow, tin ring of 
the pitiful bowl echoes through the kitchen.

>open cabinet
You open the cabinet, revealing a small box of reward nuggets and a 20 
kilo bag of dog chow.

>take bag
Taken.

Rover notices the lack of food in his soi-disant food bowl. His stomach 
rumbles with hunger.

>fill bowl
(the water bowl)
The water bowl is already full.

Something is not at all right with your left arm, it feels alternately 
numb and painful.

Rover contemplates the profound emptiness of the food bowl. He looks at 
you with imploring puppy dog eyes and then back again at his empty food 
bowl.

>fill food bowl
(first taking the food bowl)
You  empty the bag of dog chow into Rover's bowl, giving him a generous 
portion that should more than carry him through a day's worth of Rover 
antics.

Rover watches with interest as you fill his food bowl.

Your left arm is somewhat painful, like pin pricks.

>give rover food
Which do you mean, the food bowl, the doggie kibbles, or the 20 kilo bag 
of dog chow?

>give rover food bowl
(Rover the food bowl)
Rover doesn't seem interested.

>drop food bowl
Rover gulps down the food, without pausing for niceties such as breathing.

>put kibble in cupboard
You can't see any such thing.

The Kitchen
The kitchen is small but functional, with a space-saver refrigerator and a 
glass-top electric range. There is a drawer under the range. On the

you to distraction.

You are carrying nothing, which is more often than not the case when you 
wake up most days.

<beep> <beep> <beep>

>turn off alarm
You fumble with the alarm clock and accidentally push the snooze button.

The alarm clock rolls into a ball, and flies the length of the vehicle 
construction facility, chased by an eager, slobbering dalmation. In the 
Martian gravity, Rover bounds three meters into the air and sails over the 
heads of an annoyed crew in cleanroom suits working frantically on the 
main fusion rocket heavy-helium regulator. The mission director, David 
Venkatachalam, grimaces, but your mother offers you a comforting cup of

Janet: All the time, but I like the word "petulant" better than "pouty".
David: I'll stick with pouty.

<beep> <beep> <beep>

>turn off alarm
You poke the clock smartly in the middle of the snooze button.

A pudgy puppy hastily rounds a corner, sliding awkwardly on the polished 
dormitory floor. Behind it, there are flashes of light, and a rolling 
cloud, a mixture of smoke and Martian atmosphere. As the above-ground 
structures are ripped apart and lose pressure, the shivering ball of white 
fur leaps into your arms, burying its snout in the fold of your elbow. The 
Earth missiles continue to pound the university, but cannot penetrate to 
this depth. Huddled under a sturdy desk, you pet the frightened dog and 
hug it tight.


David: Do you always hit the snooze button so many times?
Janet: Yeah. The clock has been broken for years -- I can't reset the 
alarm time. It always goes off at 05:30, but I don't have to be at the 
spaceport until 08:30. Luckily, this serves a useful purpose in the 
simulation. Minimal resources are expended on each wake cycle, but if 
there were a problem during the approach, the ACU would elevate to full op 
status rapidly.

<beep> <beep> <beep>

>turn off alarm
You reach clumsily in the general direction of the alarm clock and graze 
the over-sized snooze button.

As you reach for the alarm clock, your excited dog deftly bats it off the 
cushion with his tail. The clock tumbles off the side of futon and thuds 
smartly as it hits the floor, ending the beeping. Rover looks puzzled that 
the noise has stopped.

Realizing that without the alarm clock you would probably sleep through 
the entire day, you reluctantly get out of bed.


David: Thank you. I can only take so many dream sequences.
Janet: No problem. So, at this point, the Valkyrie would be at the edge of 
the probe's stellar system, and ready to switch over from casimir to 
condensate drive and begin the approach.

As you get out of bed, you notice that your left arm is numb -- must have

There is a strange, electrical sensation running up and down your left

The Bathroom
Your cottage's living room is palatial compared to your bathroom. There is 
a pink marble counter and above it you've mounted a mirror on the wall. To 
the right of the mirror is a black glass touch plate. Between the counter 
and the shower is a white, porcelain toilet.

On the marble counter are a toothbrush and a plastic box.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover scratching 
something.

I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the black plate.

A glossy black plate that is just to the right of the bathroom mirror.

David: Is the static charge neutralization part the script?
Janet: No, that's the point of the ACU -- it isn't a set script. As we 
throw malfunctions at it in these simulations, the ACU responds 
appropriately. We can't, for instance, know that Valkyrie will accumulate 
a static charge in a particular area, so the ACU has to be flexible enough 
to react to unpredictable events.
David: Like you would.
Janet: Subject to the resolution of the synaptic scan, yes.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover sniffing something.

The Bathroom
Your cottage's living room is palatial compared to your bathroom. There is 
a pink marble counter and above it you've mounted a mirror on the wall. To 
the right of the mirror is a black glass touch plate. Between the counter 
and the shower is a white, porcelain toilet.

On the marble counter are a toothbrush and a plastic box.

>open plastic box
That's not something you can open.

>take plastic box
Taken.

>examine plastic box
A small plastic box labeled "Tooth Floss," with a blue button just below 
where the floss comes out.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover scratching himself.

>floss teeth
You have the little plastic box that dispenses floss, but no actual dental 
floss.

>press button
You grab a strand of light green dental floss as it reels out of the 
dispenser.

>floss teeth
You floss your teeth and then swallow the tasty (and nutritious) floss. 
You feel so much better now.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover snoring softly (in 
the sense that it probably can't be heard outside of the cottage).

>brush teeth
(first grabbing the toothbrush)
The toothbrush sprays each tooth with a fizzy foam, vibrates it into 
lather and rinses. Your teeth feel smooth and your breath is much 
improved.

makes it out of the bathroom, but you remember to set it down before 
stepping out.

Living Room
You are in the living room of a small cottage. Piped-in sunlight pours in 
through the room's single window, illuminating a framed picture on the

Rover looks up when he hears the old fridge open. He pokes his nose in the 
fridge and sniffs around, although he knows full well that stuff in the 
fridge is for people only and that he'd be in a heap of trouble if he got 
too curious in there.

Rover paces back and forth, looking at the the cooking range.

>l fridge
You poke around in the fridge and find a white egg.

>get egg
You pluck the white egg out of the fridge.

Janet: It's a shame we don't have enough heavy helium to bring the ship 
back.
David: I'm afraid we've put all our baskets in one egg, as it were. That 
one egg represents every bit of heavy helium refined on Mars since Phobos 
was destroyed.

>turn on range
Your stove is a Cupertino SmartRange -- there are no controls, just a 
stylish glass surface with rounded corners.

>crack egg into pan
You feel kind of grimy and not entirely awake. From past experience you 
know that cooking before your morning shower often ends in disaster. You 
put the egg and the frying pan to the side for the moment.

>enter living room
Rover can be a messy eater.  By force of habit you never bring dog bowls 
out of the kitchen, so you set the food bowl down before continuing on

Rover's Day Out
An Interactive Fiction by Janet Xiang
Release beta810 / Serial number 23920415 / Inform 10.6 build Mu-013 
(I6/v.7.1 lib 7/18N)

Rover sniffs the air and tears away from the picnic blanket. You and 
Tomasz watch with surprise as he runs, for once, away from the food. Rover 
bounds over the hedges, howling wildly, and spooks a xihuahua which had 
been playing with a tiny red ball. The so-called "shaved rat" gulps an 
oversized portion of air, extends its membranous ears and flys across the 
park into the arms of a douty grey-haired woman with a cane. Rover picks 
up the ball triumphantly, ignoring the piercing wavetrain of yips and 
indignant scolding coming, respectively, from the xihuahua and its owner. 
Shaking her cane limply towards Rover, she admonishes in an a strong Earth 
accent "That mongrel should be on a leash!" Her own, unleashed, uncollared 
neodog stares accusingly from the safety of her arms, its distensible ribs 
alternately inflating and deflating like bellows. "Your kind is ruining 
Mars, ignoring every law, dissing your elders! You never lived on the 
surface, you never don't know what you've got!". You try to give the ball 
back to her, but she pushes it away in disgust, "Kids. Meh."


David: Hey, different dream sequence. Is it glitching?
Janet: No, the ACU's dreams are heavily influenced by power-up state of 
the processor and internal noise. Every time the ship dehibernates after a 
casimir jump, it will experience some sort of dreaming. Some of them can 
be pretty bizarre.
David: Good, I'd hate to think that we wasted two weeks of programming.
Janet: I wouldn't say wasted.
David: Huh? I didn't mean us.
Janet: Cross your fingers and hope the whole thing doesn't crash again on 
the heat lamp.

<beep> <beep> <beep>

>oh god
That's not a verb I recognize.

>turn off alarm
A dalmation paw beats you to the alarm clock and scrapes the snooze button 
before you even have a chance to accidentally do it yourself.

The image of Tomasz blinks momentarily as the relay is handed off from 
ground station to ground station, trying to keep line of sight to Phobos. 
Behind him, you can see the tubular structure of the power station jutting 
over the edge of Stickley Crater. He is taking the news rather well, all 
things considered. Tomasz guesses your thoughts as you glance at your 
diamond engagement ring. "Don't sweat it,"he says. "This whole rock is 
carbon, so plenty more where that came from." There is blinding flash of 
light and the screen goes black.


David: Is the ACU referring to me?
Janet: As much as I'd like to say "yes", I don't see how. The synaptic 
scans were frozen before we started seeing each other.
David: Maybe you've had your eye on me for longer than you think.
Janet: I wonder how many relationships have been ruined by armchair 
psychoanalysis?

<beep> <beep> <beep>

>turn off alam

>turn off alam

>turn off alarm
In your early morning stupor, you squeeze the alarm clock like a water 
melon pit, sending it even nearer to the edge of the bed and incidentally 
hitting the snooze button.

An angry dwarf emerges from under the kitchen sink, spilling dog chow all 
over the floor. He throws you a menacing look, pries the fridge open with 
a black rod, and snatches an egg off the shelf. Sand pours out of the 
fridge. "Hey," you yell from the futon, "put that back". You stop short, 
realizing that this sort of distraction is exactly why you haven't 
completed your dissertation. You feel around under the futon, where you 
think you will have put the dissertation so you could find it in the past, 
and grab the stubby snout of a pig. The fleet-footed porcine slaps a fish 
into its ear, jumps into a dumbwaiter and disappears.


David: That was surreal.
Janet: And sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
David: Indeed.

<beep> <beep> <beep>

>turn off alarm
The alarm clock tumbles off the bed, but you catch it before it hits the 
ground. Setting it back on the bed, you depress the snooze button.

As you reach for the alarm clock, your excited dog deftly bats it off the 
cushion with his tail. The clock tumbles off the side of futon and thuds 
smartly as it hits the floor, ending the beeping. Rover looks puzzled that 
the noise has stopped.

Realizing that without the alarm clock you would probably sleep through 
the entire day, you reluctantly get out of bed.

>open drapes
You push aside the drapes.

David: Where are your coffee machine and toaster?
Janet: I mapped the ship functions to the minimum number of objects. More 
objects means more ways for things to go wrong and more time debugging. 
Call me lazy.
David: Lazy.
Janet: You don't know the crazy things that the ACU does! Sometimes it 
walks around trying to eat or take everything in sight. Sometimes it sings 
and jumps around. It's based on my neural bindings, but the ACU definitely 
has a mind of its own, and I don't want to have to worry about what it 
might try do with a toaster.

You crack the egg into the frying pan. The neoegg shell sublimates as the 
contents spread over the pan's non-stick surface. Immediately, the surface 
of the range glows red. When the egg is cooked sunny-side up to 
perfection, the glow fades.

Janet: If there were some heavy helium left after landing, could the ship 
take off again?
David: Hypothetically, yes, but the planet has essentially no atmosphere 
to break against and it has about nine times Earth gravity. Even with 
optimal approach we'll have to fuse every gram of that heavy helium to 
make a soft landing.
Janet: I just hate to leave the ship there. It could take years before our 
next casimir ship will be built, and who knows if Valkyrie will survive 
that long on that chthonian rock.
David: Nice word. From MARSpace perspective, all that matters is that the 
probe data are recovered.

The Kitchen
The kitchen is small but functional, with a space-saver refrigerator and a 
glass-top electric range. There is a drawer under the range. On the 
opposite wall there is a sink and under it, a storage cabinet.

On the the cooking range is a frying pan (in which is a fried white egg).

You can also see a water bowl (in which is some water) and a food bowl 
(empty) here.

>eat egg
You gobble down what might well have been the best neoegg you've ever had.

David: Wait a minute! She just scoops the egg out of the pan with her hand 
and eats it like a grizzly bear raking salmon out of a river?
Janet: Works for me, yeah.
David: How about a plate and fork?
Janet: The ACU doesn't miss them, and it's less programming overhead. And 
bonus: fewer dishes to clean.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover dragging something 
around.

You open the cabinet, revealing a 20 kilo bag of dog chow and a small box 
of reward nuggets.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover snoring loudly.

The box rattles as you pick it up. Rover is suddenly standing next to you, 
eyes wide open, and fixed on the box of treats.

>close cabinet
You close the cabinet.

>open fridge
Rover looks up when he hears the old fridge open. He sniffs the fridge 
door and decides there is nothing in the fridge worth getting in trouble 
over. He saunters out of the kitchen and back towards the living room.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover chewing something.

You poke around in the fridge and find nothing at all.

Living Room
You are in the living room of a small cottage. Piped-in sunlight pours in 
through the room's single window, illuminating a framed picture on the 
wall. The principle furnishing is a king-size purple futon which takes up 
almost all the floor space. From the living room you can see the entrance 
to the kitchen and bathroom. The cottage's front door is closed.

You can see Rover here.

Rover keeps an eye on the small box of reward nuggets.

The Bathroom
Your cottage's living room is palatial compared to your bathroom. There is 
a pink marble counter and above it you've mounted a mirror on the wall. To 
the right of the mirror is a black glass touch plate. Between the counter 
and the shower is a white, porcelain toilet.

You can see a plastic box and a toothbrush here.

Rover trundles along behind you, his attention riveted to the small box of 
reward nuggets.


Janet: So now we begin the landing cycle. This is where the ACU really 
shines.
David: What about timing? The ship has to be in the right orientation and 
to fire the fusion thrusters at exactly the right time.
Janet: The ACU works so fast that no matter how many individual steps it 
takes, the effect occurs at the right time.

>sit on toilet
(the toilet)
You sit on the toilet seat.

You can do a lot of things in your one-piece flight suit. That ain't one

Rover stretches all the way forwards, and then all the way backwards.

You stand up again.

Rover walks towards the toilet.

You take off your blue flight suit and it falls to the bathroom floor. You 
are naked.

Rover licks his front paws.

You are distracted momentarily. Something just isn't right in the

The Bathroom
Your cottage's living room is palatial compared to your bathroom. There is 
a pink marble counter and above it you've mounted a mirror on the wall. To

You can see a flight suit, Rover, a plastic box, and a toothbrush here.

Rover appears lost in thought.

>flush toilet

Before you do so, the plunger catches your attention.

>l in toilet
(the toilet)
There's something in it, but you don't want details.

>take plunger
Since the day Tomasz jammed the plunger down on the bathroom floor, it has 
been stuck there like a barbed harpoon in the side of a great whale. Well, 
maybe more like a giant squid on wrapped around an unfortunate whale, 
since squids have (you have heard) suckers. Some kind of weird interaction 
between the rubber cup and the micropores in the floor have effectively 
bonded the plunger to the floor, and any attempt to remove it would 
probably destroy one or the other. The plunger doesn't really bother you, 
and most of the time you just ignore it.

Rover prances past you at a convenient back-scratching distance.

>flush toilet
(the toilet)
Maybe you've been reading too much Lovecraft, but the plunger next to the 
toilet seems to be somehow misshapen and twisted. Its suddenly alien 
geometry suggests to you that some inchoate force of primordial corruption 
is reaching from across the stars, gibbering and gyrating contemptibly in 
the half-formed chaos between the toilet and the shower. Or maybe the 
eldritch plunger is just tilted a bit.

>straighten plunger
That's not a verb I recognize.

>take plunger
Nah. You like it where it is. It kind of reminds you of Tomasz, and his 
efforts at home repair that never quite went right.

>examine plunger
A common plumber's plunger, consisting of a wooden shaft and red rubber 
cup. Something about the plunger is not right, though. The handle of the 
plunger is tilted just the tiniest little bit  forwards and it's also 
leaning almost completely  to the right. Furthermore, its handle is 
twisted completely clockwise.

Rover contemplates the small box of reward nuggets.


Janet: When Rover brings the probe back to the ship, it will automatically 
extract the data and send it back by ansible. Did you enter the ansible 
parameters?
David: Yes, I had to do it manually since the frequency and coordinates 
are encrypted. It's too bad they didn't have FTL communications when they 
built the probes - it would have saved us the trip.
Janet: Yes, but then Earth would get the information as well -- even 
encrypted, I wouldn't want it to fall into their hands.

Rover sniffs the front door.

>open front door
Rover looks up when he hears the door begin to open. Rover slips out the 
door.


Janet: So, that's it. Rover goes out, gets the probe, brings it back to 
the ship, and then the information is squirted back to MARSpace.
David: Well, congratulations, Doctor Xiang, on a job well done. I say we 
celebrate tonight, and get up early for the launch tomorrow morning.
Janet: It's a deal. Give me ten minutes to make the final commit, and I'll 
join you.
David: I'll put the champagne on ice.

Rover's Day Out
An Interactive Fiction by Janet Xiang and David Venkatachalam
Release 1 / Serial number 23920416 / Inform 10.6 build Mu-013 (I6/v.7.1 
lib 7/18N)

Even mildly drugged and reclining on an overstuffed couch in the MARSpace 
human resources office, it's hard to relax in the presence of the MARSpace 
political officer conducting the final interview. You didn't catch her 
name, probably because she never mentioned it. After three such interviews 
and six months of background check, what more could they want?

"Ms. Xiang, thank you for your cooperation. Your tests show no hint of 
disloyalty to the Republic or MARSpace. We hope you understand the need 
for these measures, particularly for personnel with access to the 
Valkyrie's command and control functions. Now that you are cleared, I can 
inform you that credible sources have warned that the project may have 
been infiltrated by..."

<BEEP> <BEEP> <BEEP>

You weren't particularly enjoying this dream, but being jarred awake by a 
violently shaking futon is even less pleasurable.

As the bed bucks and tumbles, several scenarios flash through your mind: 
explosive decompression of the dome? Volcanic activity? Meteor impact? 
Before you can even consider your next action, you are thrown from the 
futon onto the living room floor. Light pours in from the window. It looks 
like the drapes were somehow torn away from the window.

You can see Rover here.

With a little effort, the futon folds up, snug against the wall, leaving 
more room to walk around the cramped cottage.

Rover nips at his own tail.

Rover bounds up onto the futon and begins to get comfortable, rolling his 
muzzle back and forth on the mattress. Abruptly, his head pokes up and he 
realizes that you are watching him. Recognizing the awkwardness of being 
caught on the forbidden futon, Rover slinks down behind it and slowly 
emerges. He looks over his own shoulder at the futon as if to say "I 
wonder who that dog was on the futon".

Taken.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover snoring loudly.

As the fridge creaks open on its ancient hinges, Rover slips into the 
kitchen. He pokes his nose in the fridge and sniffs around, although he 
knows full well that stuff in the fridge is for people only and that he'd 
be in a heap of trouble if he got too curious in there.

Rover slurps the water bowl dry.

>l fridge
You poke around in the fridge and find a white egg.

Rover sighs audibly and frowns at his food bowl. He looks at you with 
imploring puppy dog eyes and then back again at his empty food bowl.

You put the frying pan on the the cooking range.

You put the white egg into the frying pan.

Rover narrows his eyes critically, noting the lack of food in his food 
bowl. He paws pathetically at the food bowl, and the hollow, tin ring of 
the pitiful bowl echoes through the kitchen.

>l cabinet
In the cabinet are a small box of reward nuggets and a 20 kilo bag of dog 
chow.

Taken.

Rover contemplates the profound emptiness of the food bowl. He looks at 
the food bowl. He looks at you. He looks at the food bowl. He looks at 
you.

>take food bowl
Taken.

>fill food bowl
You  empty the bag of dog chow into Rover's bowl, giving him a generous 
portion that should more than carry him through a day's worth of Rover 
antics.

Rover watches with interest as you fill his food bowl.

>drop bowl
(the food bowl)
Rover's head disappears into the food bowl. It is hard to believe that the 
sounds generated are coming from a dog rather than some sort of industrial 
mining rig. When his head lifts, the bowl is not only empty, but has been 
buffed to a mirror finish.

>put bag in cabinet
You put the 20 kilo bag of dog chow into the cabinet.

Rover looks at the cabinet.

>take treats
You can't see any such thing.

>take nugget

into something else.

>take bag

>put bag in cabinet
You put the 20 kilo bag of dog chow into the cabinet.

>close cabinet
You close the cabinet.

>fry egg
You crack the egg into the frying pan. The neoegg shell sublimates as the 
contents spread over the pan's non-stick surface. Immediately, the surface 
of the range glows red. When the egg is cooked sunny-side up to 
perfection, the glow fades.

>eat egg
You gobble down what might well have been the best neoegg you've ever had.

On the the cooking range is a frying pan (empty).

You can also see a water bowl (in which is some water), a food bowl 
(empty), and Rover here.

>take frying pan
Taken.

>wash pan
That's not a verb I recognize.

>put pan in sink
You're tired of stuff piling up in the sink, so you stick to your New 
Year's resolution and decide to hang on to the frying pan.

The Kitchen
The kitchen is small but functional, with a space-saver refrigerator and a 
glass-top electric range. The fridge door is not completely closed. There 
is an open drawer under the range. On the opposite wall there is a sink 
and under it, a storage cabinet.

You can see a water bowl (in which is some water), a food bowl (empty), 
and Rover here.

Living Room
You are in the living room of a small cottage. Piped-in sunlight pours in 
through the room's single window, illuminating a framed picture on the 
wall -- strangely, your drapes are nowhere to be seen. The principle 
furnishing is a king-size purple futon which takes up almost all the floor 
space. From the living room you can see the entrance to the kitchen and 
bathroom. The cottage's front door is closed.

Rover trundles along behind you, his attention riveted to the small box of 
reward nuggets.

>l window
In the window are an array of skylights, a park, some grass, and some 
trees.

>examine window
The garden skylights are just coming on. They cast long shadows from a 
stand of Norwegian Spruce trees at the far side of the park.

Rover walks around the room, occasionally sniffing various spots on the 
floor.

>enter bathroom
The Bathroom
Your cottage's living room is palatial compared to your bathroom. There is 
a pink marble counter and above it you've mounted a mirror on the wall. To 
the right of the mirror is a black glass touch plate. Between the counter 
and the shower is a white, porcelain toilet.

You can see a flight suit, a toothbrush, and a plastic box here.

Rover trundles along behind you, his attention riveted to the small box of 
reward nuggets.

>remove suit

You're not wearing that.

>sit on toilet

You sit on the toilet seat.

>pee
You complete your business with great aplomb.

>poop
You've already done your business. Keep trying and you might end up with 
hemorrhoids.

>stand
You stand up again, although you are uncomfortably aware that you have 
left some, shall we say, "unresolved" business behind you.

>don suit
You put on the flight suit.

>flush toilet
(the toilet)
Obsess much? The bathroom plunger is not standing up correctly. It's 
maddening.

>l plunger
There is nothing on the plunger.

>examine plunger
A common plumber's plunger, consisting of a wooden shaft and red rubber 
cup. Something about the plunger is not right, though. The handle of the 
plunger is tilted strongly  backwards and it's also leaning just the 
tiniest little bit  to the right. Furthermore, its handle is twisted 
strongly clockwise.


Rover exhales with contentment and rolls over, feet outstretched.

>move plunger left
You adjust the plunger handle leftwards. Something about the plunger is 
not right, though. The handle of the plunger is tilted strongly 
backwards. Furthermore, its handle is twisted strongly clockwise.

>twist handle counterclockwise
You adjust the plunger handle counterclockwise. Something about the 
plunger is not right, though. The handle of the plunger is tilted strongly

Rover turns suddenly, as if he might have seen a skwerrel.

>twist handle counterclockwise
You adjust the plunger handle counterclockwise. Something about the 
plunger is not right, though. The handle of the plunger is tilted strongly 
backwards. Furthermore, its handle is twisted a tad clockwise.

straight, just the way you like it.

Rover sniffs the plastic box.

>flush toilet

There is a tinny clanking from within the toilet, but nothing happens.

>open lid
(the tank lid)
You open the water tank, revealing a flapper valve, a metapropylene lever, 
and a flush chain.

>pull chain
You pull on the small bit of chain attached to the flapper valve.

The cottage's aging plumbing rumbles and vibrates as the toilet flushes.

Rover runs out of the bathroom, and you hear him jumping around hear the 
front door.

You can see Rover here.

Rover paws at the front door.

>open front door
Rover looks up when he hears the door begin to open. Rover wiggles his 
butt through the door before you have it even half-way open, his tail 
slapping back and forth against the gate as it disappears.

There is a wrenching shift in perspective, but a moment later it seems 
perfectly natural.

You go bounding out the front door, full of energy.

The scent of your house is strong here, and you are right next to its

space. From the living room you can see the entrance to the kitchen and 
bathroom. The cottage's front door is open.

You can see Janet here.

You return to the living room with the funny-tasting rock in your mouth. 
Janet takes a look at the rock and says "You've started a rock collection? 
Well, Okay," and closes the door behind you.

Again your senses tumble and swirl as perspective shifts, but suddenly it 
seems entirely normal again.

>go to dog
The Park
A dug-up field pock marked by small holes and accompanying mounds of dirt.

You can see some paw marks here.

>examine marks
Paw marks from a medium-sized dog. From the look of the field, they must 
belong to a dog that either likes digging or was trying to find something 
important buried around here.

>dig
You dig for a while with your front paws. Finding nothing, you kick the 
dirt back in again so you won't be blamed for digging up the yard.

>smell

are shiny and black. On the walls and floor of the trench, you can see 
some scratches that look like they could have been made by dog paws.

>go to dog

You can see a female dog here.

>examine dog
Your heart catches in your throat as you stand in her glorious presence. 
Graceful, athletic, and possessed of a noble bearing, she smites you with 
a glance down her long, fine muzzle. In her amorous mouth, she is 
seductively carrying a bone almost as big as she is.

>bark
"Bow! Wow!"

No doubt in awe of your rhetorical skills, the lovely damsel drops the 
bone. Her gift to you, you suppose.

>take bone

Rover wags his tails and gnaws on his bone.

You rub his head, distantly, as strange thoughts sweep through your 
consciousness. You wonder what would happen if the Valkyrie mission 
failed. What if, during the landing sequence, the ship were buffeted by 
the planet's particulate matter being torn away by the immense gravity of 
its star? In that case, critical systems might be damaged. Systems like 
the relatively fragile ansible antenna. There is no back-up ansible 
antenna. How would the ACU cope with a situation like that? The ACU was 
designed for a lot of contingencies, but not that one. What would you do? 
What would you do if you were the ACU?

Your glance falls on your flight suit, and suddenly the question is no 
longer rhetorical.

Living Room
The Valkyrie's cargo bay is like a great, metal cave. On one wall, the 
casimir drive intrudes slightly into the cargo area. From this section of 
the ship, there are connections to the engineering and flight control 
decks. The cargo bay doors are closed.

You can see ROVER and a lump of thorium ore here.

You walk into the tumbledown shack. There is a man here who looks old and 
grumpy. Like your home, this place has a sleeping room and an eating room. 
It looks like you've walked right into the sleeping room.

The man yells at you and you tuck your head down. "Blah, blah, blah!" He 
doesn't seem to move though. Maybe he can't move.

Nope. No movement. Hmph. You don't feel so afraid of him.

too. Next to the water maker is a table that is too tall to be reached
