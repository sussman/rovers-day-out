Rover's Day Out
An Interactive Simulation by Janet Xiang
Release beta 732 / Serial number 23920401 / Inform 10.6 build Mu-013 (I6/v.7.1 lib 7/18N)

Rover draws pensively on his stubby cigar, the tip glowing red below his dealer's hat. He paws nonchalantly at the scotch and water he has been nursing for the last half hour. Despite the tower of chips in front of him, he's either in trouble now, or trying to play the rest of the table for suckers. His tail is no longer wagging, though, and you suspect that the scotch may be getting the better of him. He can't mass more than about 30 kilos, and he's been putting them away tonight. You push all in, figuring that even if you lose it all, at least you'll get some sleep before you need to get back to the MARSpace. Elva the cleaning lady folds, as does Isaac Asimov and that boy that you kissed in fourth grade. Wait...don't go....where is everyone going?

Living Room
You are in the living room of a small cottage. Piped-in sunlight pours in through the room's single window, illuminating a framed picture on the opposite wall. The principal furnishing is a king-size purple futon which takes up almost all the floor space. From the living room you can see the entrance to the kitchen and bathroom. The cottage's front door is closed.

You can see an alarm clock and Rover here.

>get up
You are standing in the living room.

>open door
If you open the front door, Rover will get all excited and expect to go walkies. Better get your morning routine out of the way first.

>e
Compass directions? On Mars? The magnetic field here is too weak.

Rover seems relaxed.

>bathroom
That's not a verb I recognize.

>go bathroom
You can't really move around much because of the futon. It takes up a lot of room.



David: Isn't that a tad inconvenient?
Janet: Yeah, but it kind of made sense when I got it.

>fold up futon
With a little effort, the futon folds up, snug against the wall, leaving more room to walk around the cramped cottage.

>go bathroom
Bathroom
Your cottage's living room is palatial compared to your bathroom. There is a pink marble counter and above it you've mounted a mirror on the wall. To the right of the mirror is a black glass plate. Between the counter and the shower is a white, porcelain toilet.

On the marble counter are a toothbrush and a plastic box.

>use toilet
You can do a lot of things in your one-piece flight suit. That ain't one of them.

>From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover breathing quietly (quietly for Rover, who is a heavy breather).

>take off clothes
You take off your blue flight suit and it falls to the bathroom floor. You are naked.



David: I don't think I should be seeing this. I mean, I'm
       your boss. There's that whole power dynamic thing.
Janet: Don't worry: I'm not inclined to sue you for staring
       at a simulation.
David: I'm not staring at the stimulation.
Janet: You said stimulation. That's funny.
David: No, I said simulation - and I'm not staring.
Janet: Alright -- you're the boss.

>From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover barking at something.

>use toilet
You're willing to hold it until you can sit down properly on a toilet seat, thank you very much.

>sit on toilet
Sitting on the ceramic rim of the toilet bowl would be absolutely too gross to contemplate.

>put down seat
You weren't holding the toilet seat to begin with.

>x toilet
A plain vanilla toilet, having a water tank and bowl. Nothing to write home about. Someone left both the cover and seat up. How rude.

A plunger stands next to the toilet, between it and the shower.

>put seat down
You weren't holding the toilet seat to begin with.

>From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover scratching himself.

>seat down
That's not a verb I recognize.

I didn't understand that sentence.

>push seat down
The toilet seat cannot be pushed from place to place.

>fold
You can't fold the toilet.

Bathroom
Your cottage's living room is palatial compared to your bathroom. There is a pink marble counter and above it you've mounted a mirror on the wall. To the right of the mirror is a black glass plate. Between the counter and the shower is a white, porcelain toilet.

On the marble counter are a toothbrush and a plastic box.

You can also see a flight suit here.

>brush teeth
(first grabbing the toothbrush)
The toothbrush sprays each tooth with a fizzy foam, vibrates it into lather and rinses. Your teeth feel smooth and your breath is much improved.

>From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover snoring softly (in the sense that it probably can't be heard outside of the cottage).

>x box
A small plastic box labeled "Tooth Floss," with a blue button just below where the floss comes out.

>From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover growling at something.

>floss teeth
You don't have any floss.

>get floss
You can't see any such thing.

>push button
(first taking the plastic box)
You grab a strand of light green dental floss as it reels out of the dispenser.

>From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover snoring loudly.

>floss teeth
You floss your teeth and then swallow the tasty (and nutritious) floss. You feel so much better now.

>x toilet
A plain vanilla toilet, having a water tank and bowl. Nothing to write home about. Someone left both the cover and seat up. How rude.

A plunger stands next to the toilet, between it and the shower.

>From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover chewing something.

>x plunger
A common plumber's plunger, consisting of a wooden shaft and red rubber cup. Something about the plunger just doesn't look proper. The handle of the plunger is tilted half-way forwards and it's also leaning a little bit to the left. Furthermore, its handle is twisted a little bit counterclockwise.

>push plunger right
You adjust the plunger handle rightwards. That helped.

Something about the plunger just doesn't look proper. The handle of the plunger is tilted half-way forwards. Furthermore, its handle is twisted a little bit counterclockwise.

You adjust the plunger handle backwards. Certainly, a step in the right direction.

Something about the plunger just doesn't look proper. The handle of the plunger is tilted a little bit forwards. Furthermore, its handle is twisted a little bit counterclockwise.

>push plunger backwards
You adjust the plunger handle backwards. The plunger is now less offensive to your artistic sense of space and proportion.

Something about the plunger just doesn't look proper. The handle of the plunger is twisted a little bit counterclockwise.

>twist plunger clockwise
You adjust the plunger handle clockwise. That improved the situation.

The plunger stands perfectly straight, just the way you like it.

>put toilet seat down
You weren't holding the toilet seat to begin with.

>From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover playing.

>close toilet
You lower the toilet cover into position.

>* aha!!!
That's not a verb I recognize.

>open toilet
You lift the toilet cover.

>sit on toilet
You sit on the toilet seat.

>use toilet
You're a creature of habit. Maybe after breakfast? That's what your list on the fridge recommends, at least.

>get up
You stand up again.

>From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover running in circles.

>shower
That's not a verb I recognize.

Bathroom
Your cottage's living room is palatial compared to your bathroom. There is a pink marble counter and above it you've mounted a mirror on the wall. To the right of the mirror is a black glass plate. Between the counter and the shower is a white, porcelain toilet.

You can see a flight suit here.

>x shower
A utilitarian shower.

>use shower
You'll have to enter the shower first.

>enter shower
The last time you walked out of the bathroom with your toothbrush, you never found it again. You toss it on the counter. The plastic box almost makes it out of the bathroom, but you remember to set it down before stepping out. 

Shower
You are in your shower and water of just the right temperature is spraying down on you. Two buttons are molded into the wall of the shower stall. One is labeled "soap", and the other, "shampoo". 



David: Janet, I...
Janet: David, if it were anyone but you, I would have a problem.
       Just let it go.
David: Anyone else? Like who?
Janet: Can we get back to the program?
David: Okay, I'm paying attention.
Janet: Obviously.

>From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover jumping around.

>push soap button
A stream of hot, pearlescent white soap is ejected forcefully from the throbbing button, and pools in your hand. You rub it over your entire body with wanton abandon and then rinse it off.


David: No comment.
Janet: I don't know what I was thinking when I wrote that.

>push shampoo button
You wash your hair. It no longer feels like a straw-encrusted swarm of red-headed tommygoffs.

>From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover sniffing something.

Janet: Crap.  The ACU crashed.
David: Windex?
Janet: It's the Myomita operating system. It's backwards
       compatible to the 20th century. Maybe earlier.
David: We can't use Windex as the substrate for the ACU --
       it's too critical. Can it run under Flosix?
Janet: Yes, but it will take some time to install and debug.
David: I can help you, the rest of the ship is Flosix, stem
       to stern. I live and breathe Flosix.
Janet: Happy to have the help -- how about dinner first?
David: Do you like Thai?

Rover's Day Out
An Interactive Simulation by Janet Xiang
Release beta810 / Serial number 23920415 / Inform 10.6 build Mu-013 (I6/v.7.1 lib 7/18N)

Rover sniffs the air and tears away from the picnic blanket. You and Tomasz watch with surprise as he runs, for once, away from the food. Rover bounds over the hedges, howling wildly, and spooks a xihuahua that had been playing with a tiny red ball. The so-called "shaved rat" gulps an oversized portion of air, extends its membranous ears, and flies across the park into the arms of a stooped grey-haired woman with a cane. Rover picks up the ball triumphantly, ignoring the piercing wavetrain of yips and indignant scolding coming, respectively, from the xihuahua and its owner. Shaking her cane limply towards Rover, she admonishes in a strong Earth accent "That mongrel should be on a leash!" Her own, unleashed, uncollared neodog stares accusingly from the safety of her arms, its distensible ribs alternately inflating and deflating like bellows. "Your kind is ruining Mars, ignoring every law, dissing your elders! You never lived on the surface, you never don't know what you've got!". You try to give the ball back to her, but she pushes it away in disgust, "Kids. Meh."



David: Hey, different dream sequence. Is it glitching?
Janet: No, the ACU's dreams are heavily influenced by power-up
       state of the processor and internal noise. Every time
       the ship dehibernates after a Casimir jump, it will
       experience some sort of dreaming. Some of them can
       be pretty bizarre.
David: Good, I'd hate to think that we wasted two weeks of
       programming.
Janet: I wouldn't say wasted.
David: Huh? I didn't mean us.
Janet: Cross your fingers and hope the whole thing doesn't
       crash again on the heat lamp.

<beep> <beep> <beep>

>wake up
Gathering your resolve, you slowly slide off the side of the futon, inadvertently sending the alarm clock on a death spiral off the edge of the futon. Oh well, you can find it later. Meanwhile, you slowly stand up, recapitulating millions of years of evolution in a few seconds.



David: Thank you. I can only take so many dream sequences.
Janet: No problem. So, at this point, the Valkyrie would
       be at the edge of the probe's stellar system, and
       ready to switch over from Casimir to condensate drive
       and begin the approach.

Living Room
Where the heavy drapes meet, a sliver of sunlight shines into the otherwise dark living room. A framed picture hangs on the living room wall in the small area illuminated by the shaft of light.

>open drapes
You push aside the drapes.

Janet: David, what's the ablative coating for? I thought
       that most of that planet's atmosphere had been cooked
       off long ago.
David: Not really my department. Maybe it's supposed to help
       with the heat.
Janet: I've heard temps up to 1000 Kelvin?
David: In that ballpark. They think the probe impacted on
       the star-facing side of the planet. Estimates put
       the surface temp there between 800 and 1200 K.

The heat lamp on the ceiling flares to a brilliant red, and you dry in an instant. You now feel fresh and ready to face the day.

Kitchen
The kitchen is small but functional, with a space-saver refrigerator and a glass-top electric range. There is a drawer under the range. On the opposite wall there is a sink and under it, a storage cabinet.

You can see a water bowl (empty) and a food bowl (empty) here.



David: Where are your coffee machine and toaster?
Janet: I mapped the ship functions to the minimum number
       of objects. More objects means more ways for things
       to go wrong and more time debugging. Call me lazy.
David: Lazy.
Janet: You don't know the crazy things the ACU does! Sometimes
       it walks around trying to eat or take everything in
       sight. Sometimes it sings and jumps around. It's based
       on my neural bindings, but the ACU definitely has
       a mind of its own, and I don't want to have to worry
       about what it might try do with a toaster.

>x refrigerator
The small refrigerator dates back to the International Era, but is still in good working order, if somewhat small by today's standards. The glossy, white enameled unit has a single compartment. A strip of yellow magpaper is attached to the refrigerator door.



David: Isn't a "to-do" list a little heavy handed?
Janet: Sure, but stuff has to happen in a certain order,
       and it's just more efficient this way.
David: I think it would be better if it were less linear
       and more rule-based.
Janet: Okay, mister critic, then you write the code. If we
       want to recover that probe before Earth gets to it,
       we are on a very tight development and testing schedule.

Morning:

5. Let Rover go walkies



David: "Take care of business"? Is that a euphemism?
Janet: Yes. I had a heck of a time mapping the landing sequence
       to my daily routine.

>open refrigerator
As the fridge creaks open on its ancient hinges, Rover slips into the kitchen. He pokes his nose in the fridge and sniffs around, although he knows full well that stuff in the fridge is for people only and that he'd be in a heap of trouble if he got too curious in there.

Rover notices the lack of food in his soi-disant food bowl. He looks at you with imploring puppy dog eyes and then back again at his empty food bowl.

He eyes the empty water bowl thirstily.

>fill bow
You can't see any such thing.

>fill bowl
Which do you mean, the water bowl, or the food bowl?

>water
(first taking the water bowl)
You run the sink briefly to make sure the water is cold, and then fill Rover's bowl about halfway up.

Rover looks towards the sink as you fill his water bowl.

Rover tingles with anticipation as he stares at the bowl you're carrying.

>give bowl to rover
(the water bowl to Rover)
Rover shivers with excitement as you put the full water bowl on the ground.

Rover contemplates the profound emptiness of the food bowl. He paws pathetically at the food bowl, and the hollow, tin ring of the pitiful bowl echoes through the kitchen.

Rover drinks the water.

>fill food bowl
You would need some dog food.

>l
Kitchen
The kitchen is small but functional, with a space-saver refrigerator and a glass-top electric range. The fridge door is not completely closed. There is a drawer under the range. On the opposite wall there is a sink and under it, a storage cabinet.

You can see a water bowl (empty), Rover, and a food bowl (empty) here.

>open cabinet
You open the cabinet, revealing a reward nugget replicator and a 20 kilo bag of dog chow.

>fill food bowl
(first taking the food bowl)
(first taking the bag of dog chow)
You  empty the bag of dog chow into Rover's bowl, giving him a generous portion that should more than carry him through a day's worth of Rover antics.

Rover watches with interest as you fill his food bowl.

Rover outright gapes at the bowl you carry, then gently sniffs it in hope that you'll give it to him.

>give food to rover
Which do you mean, the 20 kilo bag of dog chow, the food bowl, or the doggie kibbles?

>food bowl
I only understood you as far as wanting to food.

>give bowl to rover
(the food bowl to Rover)
Rover smacks his lips as you lay the bowl down for him.

Rover's head disappears into the food bowl. It is hard to believe that the sounds generated are coming from a dog rather than some sort of industrial mining rig. When his head lifts, the bowl is not only empty but has been buffed to a mirror finish.

Kitchen
The kitchen is small but functional, with a space-saver refrigerator and a glass-top electric range. The fridge door is not completely closed. There is a drawer under the range. On the opposite wall there is a sink and under it, an open storage cabinet.

Rover nips at his own tail.

>open fridge
That's already open.

>x fridge
The small refrigerator dates back to the International Era, but is still in good working order, if somewhat small by today's standards. The glossy, white enameled unit has a single compartment. A strip of yellow magpaper is attached to the refrigerator door. The fridge door is open, chilling the kitchen and wasting power.

Rover tucks his nose under his front paws.

>close fridge
You close the old fridge.

You put the frying pan on the the cooking range.

>close cabinet
You close the cabinet.

>put egg in pan
You put the white egg into the frying pan.

>From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover scratching something.

>crack egg
You crack the egg into the frying pan. The neoegg shell sublimates as the contents spread over the pan's non-stick surface. Immediately, the surface of the range glows red. When the egg is cooked sunny-side up to perfection, the glow fades.


Janet: If there were some heavy helium left after landing,
       could the ship take off again?
David: Hypothetically, yes, but the planet has essentially
       no atmosphere to break against and it has about nine
       times Earth gravity. Even with optimal approach we'll
       have to fuse every gram of that heavy helium to make
       a soft landing.
Janet: I just hate to leave the ship there. It could take
       years before our next Casimir ship will be built,
       and who knows if Valkyrie will survive that long on
       that chthonian rock.
David: Nice word. From MARSpace perspective, all that matters
       is that the probe data are recovered.

>* "break"
That's not a verb I recognize.

>eat egg
You gobble down what might well have been the best neoegg you've ever had.


David: Wait a minute! She just scoops the egg out of the
       pan with her hand and eats it like a grizzly bear
       raking salmon out of a river?
Janet: Works for me, yeah.
David: How about a plate and fork?
Janet: The ACU doesn't miss them, and it's less programming
       overhead. And bonus: fewer dishes to clean.

>From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover growling at something.

>x list
It is a to-do list, in your own writing.

>From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover sniffing something.

>read list
Morning:
X. Get up
X. Shower
X. Breakfast
4. Take care of business
5. Let Rover go walkies

>From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover scratching himself.

>go bathroom
It took a lot of training to get Rover to eat it in the kitchen, so rather than walk out with a bag of dog food, you put it back in the cabinet. 

Bathroom
Your cottage's living room is palatial compared to your bathroom. There is a pink marble counter and above it you've mounted a mirror on the wall. To the right of the mirror is a black glass plate. Between the counter and the shower is a white, porcelain toilet.

On the marble counter are a plastic box and a toothbrush.



Janet: So now we begin the landing cycle. This is where the
       ACU really shines.
David: What about timing? The ship has to be in the right
       orientation to fire the fusion thrusters at exactly
       the right time.
Janet: The ACU works so fast that no matter how many individual
       steps it takes, the effect occurs at the right time.

>sit on toilet
You sit on the toilet seat.

>use toilet
You can do a lot of things in your one-piece flight suit. That ain't one of them.

>get up
You stand up again.

>take off suit
You take off your blue flight suit and it falls to the bathroom floor. You are naked.

>sit on toilet
You sit on the toilet seat.

>From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover walking in your direction.

>use toilet
You complete your business with great aplomb.

>From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover snoring loudly.

>wipe
You achieve nothing by this.

>From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover chewing something.

>get up
You stand up again, although you are uncomfortably aware that you have left some, shall we say, "unresolved" business behind you.

>flush toilet
The cottage's aging plumbing rumbles and vibrates as the toilet flushes.



David: That's it. One long burn down to the planet's surface.
David: And then, the ACU just needs to deploy the ROVER.

>From the living room, Rover gives a short bark and scratches at the front door.

>put on suite
You can't see any such thing.

>put on suit
(first taking the flight suit)
You put on the flight suit.

>go living room
Living Room
You are in the living room of a small cottage. Piped-in sunlight pours in through the room's single window, illuminating a framed picture on the opposite wall. The principal furnishing is a king-size purple futon which takes up almost all the floor space. From the living room you can see the entrance to the kitchen and bathroom. The cottage's front door is closed.

You can see Rover and an alarm clock here.



Janet: When Rover brings the probe back to the ship, it will
       automatically extract the data and send it back by
       ansible. Did you enter the ansible parameters?
David: Yes, I had to do it manually, since the frequency
       and coordinates are encrypted. It's too bad they didn't
       have FTL communications when they built the probes
       -- it would have saved us the trip.
Janet: Yes, but then Earth would get the information as well
       -- even encrypted, I wouldn't want it to fall into
       their hands.

Rover paws at the front door.

>open door
Rover looks up when he hears the door begin to open. You swing the front door fully open, confident that Rover will walk about the park and then return. Rover is out in a flash.



Janet: So, that's it. Rover goes out, gets the probe, and
       brings it back to the ship, and then the information
       is squirted back to MARSpace.
David: Well, congratulations, Doctor Xiang, on a job well
       done. I say we celebrate tonight, and get up early
       for the launch tomorrow morning.
Janet: It's a deal. Give me ten minutes to make the final
       commit, and I'll join you.
David: I'll put the champagne on ice.

Rover's Day Out
An Interactive Simulation by Janet Xiang and David Venkatachalam
Release 1 / Serial number 23920416 / Inform 10.6 build Mu-013 (I6/v.7.1 lib 7/18N)

Even mildly drugged and reclining on an overstuffed couch in the MARSpace human resources office, it's hard to relax in the presence of the MARSpace political officer conducting the final interview. You didn't catch her name, probably because she never mentioned it. After three such interviews and six months of background check, what more could they want?  

"Ms. Xiang, thank you for your cooperation. Your tests show no hint of disloyalty to the Republic or MARSpace. We hope you understand the need for these measures, particularly for personnel with access to the Valkyrie's command and control functions. Now that you are cleared, I can inform you that credible sources have warned that the project may have been infiltrated by..."

<BEEP> <BEEP> <BEEP>

You weren't particularly enjoying this dream, but being jarred awake by a violently shaking futon is even less pleasurable.

As the bed bucks and tumbles, several scenarios flash through your mind: explosive decompression of the dome? Volcanic activity? Meteor impact? Before you can even consider your next action, you are thrown from the futon onto the living room floor. Light pours in from the window. It looks like the drapes were somehow torn away from the window.

Living Room
You are in the living room of a small cottage. Piped-in sunlight pours in through the room's single window, illuminating a framed picture on the opposite wall -- strangely, your drapes are nowhere to be seen. The principal furnishing is a king-size purple futon which takes up almost all the floor space. From the living room you can see the entrance to the kitchen and bathroom. The cottage's front door is closed.

You can see an alarm clock and Rover here.

>fold futon
With a little effort, the futon folds up, snug against the wall, leaving more room to walk around the cramped cottage.

>go bathroom
Bathroom
Your cottage's living room is palatial compared to your bathroom. There is a pink marble counter and above it you've mounted a mirror on the wall. To the right of the mirror is a black glass plate. Between the counter and the shower is a white, porcelain toilet.

On the marble counter are a plastic box and a toothbrush.

>brush teeth
(first grabbing the toothbrush)
The toothbrush sprays each tooth with a fizzy foam, vibrates it into lather and rinses. Your teeth feel smooth and your breath is much improved.

>push button
(first taking the plastic box)
You grab a strand of light green dental floss as it reels out of the dispenser.

>floss teeth
You floss your teeth and then swallow the tasty (and nutritious) floss. You feel so much better now.

>x plunger
A common plumber's plunger, consisting of a wooden shaft and red rubber cup. Something about the plunger just doesn't look proper. The handle of the plunger is tilted completely backwards. Furthermore, its handle is twisted a little bit clockwise.

>push plunger forwards.g.g
You adjust the plunger handle forwards. That helped.

Something about the plunger just doesn't look proper. The handle of the plunger is tilted half-way backwards. Furthermore, its handle is twisted a little bit clockwise.

You adjust the plunger handle forwards. Ah, that's better.

Something about the plunger just doesn't look proper. The handle of the plunger is tilted a little bit backwards. Furthermore, its handle is twisted a little bit clockwise.

>From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover snoring softly (in the sense that it probably can't be heard outside of the cottage).

You adjust the plunger handle forwards. The plunger is now less offensive to your artistic sense of space and proportion.

Something about the plunger just doesn't look proper. The handle of the plunger is twisted a little bit clockwise.

>turn plunger counterclockwise
You adjust the plunger handle counterclockwise. That improved the situation.

The plunger stands perfectly straight, just the way you like it.

>close toilet
You lower the toilet cover into position.

>open it
You lift the toilet cover.

>From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover walking about.

>take off suit
You take off your blue flight suit and it falls to the bathroom floor. You are naked.

>From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover rolling around on the floor.

>enter shower
The last time you walked out of the bathroom with your toothbrush, you never found it again. You toss it on the counter. The plastic box almost makes it out of the bathroom, but you remember to set it down before stepping out. 

Shower
You are in your shower and water of just the right temperature is spraying down on you. Two buttons are molded into the wall of the shower stall. One is labeled "soap", and the other, "shampoo". 

>push soap
A soapy paste is dispensed from the button, and you lather up.

>From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover barking at something.

>push shampoo
You wash your hair. It no longer feels like a straw-encrusted swarm of red-headed tommygoffs.

>ot
That's not a verb I recognize.

>out

Bathroom
Your cottage's living room is palatial compared to your bathroom. There is a pink marble counter and above it you've mounted a mirror on the wall. To the right of the mirror is a black glass plate. Between the counter and the shower is a white, porcelain toilet.

On the marble counter are a plastic box and a toothbrush.

You can also see a flight suit here.

>push black plate
The heat lamp on the ceiling flares to a brilliant red, and you dry in an instant. You now feel fresh and ready to face the day.

>put on suit
(first taking the flight suit)
You put on the flight suit.

>From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover doing whatever it is he does when he's not out for walkies and he thinks he's out of your sight.

>go kitchen
Kitchen
The kitchen is small but functional, with a space-saver refrigerator and a glass-top electric range. There is an open drawer under the range. On the opposite wall there is a sink and under it, an open storage cabinet.

You can see a food bowl (empty) and a water bowl (empty) here.

>open cabinet
That's already open.

>open refrigerator
As you pull on the refrigerator door, it grudgingly creaks a few millimeters.

>open refrigerator
As the fridge creaks open on its ancient hinges, Rover slips into the kitchen. He pokes his nose in the fridge and sniffs around, although he knows full well that stuff in the fridge is for people only and that he'd be in a heap of trouble if he got too curious in there.

Rover eyes the empty water bowl thirstily.

>x refrigerator
The small refrigerator dates back to the International Era, but is still in good working order, if somewhat small by today's standards. Before this morning, you had never really appreciated just how dented and dinged up the front of the fridge had become. Maybe it's time to think about applying for a new one. A strip of yellow magpaper is attached to the refrigerator door. The fridge door is open, chilling the kitchen and wasting power.

Rover sighs audibly and frowns at his food bowl. He looks at the food bowl. He looks at you. He looks at the food bowl. He looks at you.

>look inside fridge
You poke around in the fridge and find a white egg.

>get egg
Taken.

Rover narrows his eyes critically, noting the lack of food in his food bowl. His stomach rumbles with hunger.

>close refrigerator
You close the old fridge.

Rover eyes the empty water bowl thirstily.

>l
Kitchen
The kitchen is small but functional, with a space-saver refrigerator and a glass-top electric range. There is an open drawer under the range. On the opposite wall there is a sink and under it, an open storage cabinet.

You can see Rover, a food bowl (empty), and a water bowl (empty) here.

Rover eyes the empty water bowl thirstily.

>x drawer
A deep drawer under the the cooking range. The drawer has been opened.

Rover eyes the empty water bowl thirstily.

>look in drawer
In the drawer is a frying pan.

>get pan
Taken.

Rover eyes the empty water bowl thirstily.

>put pan on range
You put the frying pan on the the cooking range.

>fry egg
You wonder whether the egg wouldn't cook better if you actually put it in the frying pan.

>crack egg
That would make a mess. You'd only break the egg into a pan.

Rover eyes the empty water bowl thirstily.

>crack egg in pan
You crack the egg into the frying pan. The neoegg shell sublimates as the contents spread over the pan's non-stick surface. Immediately, the surface of the range glows red. When the egg is cooked sunny-side up to perfection, the glow fades.

Rover rubs his nose.

>eat egg
You gobble down what might well have been the best neoegg you've ever had.

Rover eyes the empty water bowl thirstily.

>fill bowl
Which do you mean, the food bowl, or the water bowl?

>water
(first taking the water bowl)
You run the sink briefly to make sure the water is cold, and then fill Rover's bowl about halfway up.

Rover looks towards the sink as you fill his water bowl.

Rover stares longingly at the bowl in your hand.

>give bowl to rover
(the water bowl to Rover)
Rover shivers with excitement as you put the full water bowl on the ground.

Rover contemplates the profound emptiness of the food bowl. He looks at you with imploring puppy dog eyes and then back again at his empty food bowl.

Rover slurps the water bowl dry.

>open cupboard
You can't see any such thing.

>l
Kitchen
The kitchen is small but functional, with a space-saver refrigerator and a glass-top electric range. There is an open drawer under the range. On the opposite wall there is a sink and under it, an open storage cabinet.

On the the cooking range is a frying pan (empty).

You can also see a water bowl (empty), Rover, and a food bowl (empty) here.

>x cabinet
The small wooden cabinet under the sink is open.

Rover sighs audibly and frowns at his food bowl. He looks at the food bowl. He looks at you. He looks at the food bowl. He looks at you.

>look in cabinet
In the cabinet are a reward nugget replicator and a 20 kilo bag of dog chow.

>fill food bowl
(first taking the food bowl)
(first taking the bag of dog chow)
You  empty the bag of dog chow into Rover's bowl, giving him a generous portion that should more than carry him through a day's worth of Rover antics.

Rover watches with interest as you fill his food bowl.

Rover is obviously waiting for you to give him a bowl.

>feed rover
What do you want to feed Rover?

>bowl
I only understood you as far as wanting to feed Rover Rover.

>feed rover food bowl
(Rover the food bowl)
Rover smacks his lips as you lay the bowl down for him.

Rover makes short work of the food in his bowl.

>x tank
A porcelain reservoir containing several liters of water to flush the toilet. On the front of the tank there is a silver knob used to flush the toilet and on the top of the tank there is a lid.

You open the water tank, revealing a flapper valve, a metapropylene lever, and a flush chain.

>From the direction of the kitchen, you hear Rover chewing something.

>x valve
A black rubber valve that seals the bottom of the water tank, allowing the toilet to flush only when it is pulled upward by the chain that connects it to the flush lever.

>From the direction of the kitchen, you hear Rover walking about.

>x lever
The small white metapropylene lever on the inside of the water tank pivots up and down when the silver knob on the outside of the tank is turned. The lever in turn pulls on the chain that runs down to the flapper valve. Unfortunately, that chain has broken.

>* metapropylene -- nice :)
That's not a verb I recognize.

>x chain
A metal chain that would normally connect the flush lever to the flapper valve. The chain has rusted away.

>From the direction of the kitchen, you hear Rover dragging something around.

Living Room
You are in the living room of a small cottage.

Here are some practical pointers for this game:

* Try everything you can think of. If it doesn't work, try rephrasing.
* Reread text to make sure you didn't miss anything.
* Leave no stone unturned; conversely, don't obsess.
* This game follows many, but not all, of the conventions of computer adventure games. If something makes sense to you, try it even though it "shouldn't work".
* As far as we know, it is not possible to get trapped in an unwinnable situation. By winning, we mean you can complete the game. Achieving good outcomes is another matter.
* If you are really stuck, put the game aside and let it percolate through your subconscious for a while. Come back fresh.
* If you are really really stuck, con someone else into playing the game and watch them. You might get some ideas.
* If you are really and truly stuck, you could search the Internet and see if someone has already posted a similar question/answer. Since you could be playing this years after it was released, maybe we've even created a FAQ about it. If you do post a question or answer, preface your message with a spoiler warning and skip down a bunch of lines before writing anything too revealing.
* Failing all else, you can email us at: rover@red-bean.com and tell us in detail how our game has defeated your best efforts. We may be able to give you a hint that wouldn't spoil the rest of the game for you.
* IFComp 2009 special bonus: As part of IFComp, we have supplied a walkthrough document that shows one possible way of working your way through the game. It doesn't hit all the fun stuff, but it will get you from start to finish.

Front Yard
The scent of your house is strong here, and you are right next to its front door. You can't see far because it is so dusty here. The wind picks up, making it even more difficult to see.

>x me
You're a fun-loving, easy-going dog, who's fun to be around. You smell like a red-blooded, male dog in his prime.

>smell
It smells like the outdoors here. From a long way off you smell the stench of a man. Interestingly, you detect the thought-provoking perfume of a female dog carried across the park by the wind. The soothing smell of home is a hop, lick, and a bark away.

>go to man
Trot, trot, trot.

The Park
You are outside.

You can see a lump of rock here.

>x rock
You taste the rock. Not edible. Not a bone. Not interesting.

>smell
It smells dry and stale here. From a considerable distance you smell the disagreeable scent of a man. Interestingly, you detect the stimulating scent of a female dog wafting enticingly from not too far away. The cheerful smell of home is two shakes of a tail from here.

>go to man
You let your nose lead the way.

The Park
A dug-up field pockmarked by small holes and accompanying mounds of dirt.

You can see some paw marks here.

>x marks
Paw marks from a medium-sized dog. From the look of the field, they must belong to a dog that either likes digging or was trying to find something important buried around here.

>smell
It smells of freshly turned soil here. From a ways off you smell the odor of a man. Interestingly, you detect the diverting aroma of a female dog coloring the air with its lovely scent from only a short run away. The comforting smell of home is a short run from here.

>go to man
You bound away towards your goal.

The Park
A long, dark furrow scars the ground in this part of the park.

You can see a long furrow (empty) here.

>x furrow
On your muzzle, you can feel heat radiating from the furrow walls, which are shiny and black. On the walls and floor of the trench, you can see some scratches that look like they could have been made by dog paws.

>smell
It smells like burnt marshmallows here. From some distance you smell the stale funk of a man. Interestingly, you detect the engrossing bouquet of a female dog coming from somewhere really close. The heartening smell of home is still present.

>go to dog
You trot off in that direction.

The Park
A wide-open plain extends in all directions, as far as the dust permits you to see. It sure would be easy to get lost in this part of the park.

You can see a female dog here.

>x dog
Your heart catches in your throat as you stand in her glorious presence. Graceful, athletic, and possessed of a noble bearing, she smites you with a glance down her long, fine muzzle. In her angelic mouth, she is provocatively carrying a bone almost as big as she is.

>x bone
It is the biggest, juiciest bone you've ever seen. You envy the bone, which is clamped between the bewitchingly white teeth of the female dog.

>get bone
It is a nice bone...but how would she feel if you just took it? She might find that playful, but then again, she might take it the wrong way. She might like resent such a bold move, uninvited. On the other hand, she could be secretly wishing that you'd make the first move. It might be just the right thing. It could also be a dreadful mistake though. You might come across as greedy and pushy. Not the sort of impression you'd like to make... Um. What were you thinking about? You forget.

>wag
That's not a verb I recognize.

>bow
That's not a verb I recognize.

>whine
That's not a verb I recognize.

>bark
"Gaa....Ruffff!"

No doubt in awe of your rhetorical skills, the lovely damsel drops the bone. Her gift to you, you suppose.

>???
That's not a verb I recognize.

>get bone
You take the bone in your mouth.

>x dog
Your eyes are drawn to her perfectly rounded shoulders and haunches, her long arcing tail, and her soft, pendulous ears. You avert your gaze so as not to appear overly forward.

The female dog is left dumbfounded by your brilliance. She stares at the ground, unsure of herself.

>i
In your mouth, you are carrying a bone.

>go man
You eagerly scamper that way.

The Park
You are right outside a dilapidated shack, which has clearly been neglected.

>x shack
The shabby shack could use more than a coat of paint. The walls are bent at strange angles, and the door is askew.

>x door
A heavy plastrex door hangs loosely in the door frame, tenuously attached by one frail hinge. The door swings wildly in the wind.

>go man
You scuttle forth.

Sleeping Room
You walk into the tumbledown shack. There is a man here who looks old and grumpy. Like your home, this place has a sleeping room and an eating room. It looks like you've walked right into the sleeping room.

The man yells at you and you tuck your head down. "Blah, blah, blah!" He doesn't seem to move though. Maybe he can't move.

Nope. No movement. Hmph. You don't feel so afraid of him.

You can see a pink pillow here.

>x pillow
A puffy, pink pillow with a pretty design on it: a red ball, with radiating red and white rays.

>go eating room
You bound away towards your goal.

Eating Room
The room has big cold box just like the eating room in your home. It's less loud in this room, but you can hear the man in the other room yelling, "Blah, blah, blah, blah, dog? Blah! Blah, blah!". On the floor, there are two dishes.

You can see a food dish (in which is some canned food) and a water dish (in which is some crystal clear water) here.

>go home
You eagerly scamper that way.

Sleeping Room
The smelly man's house is boring. The only furniture in the room is a pullout sofa. In one direction lies the eating room, in the other, the door that leads back to the park. The smelly man is still here and carrying on, "Bad dog! Blah!"

You ignore him.

You can see a pink pillow here.

>go home
You let your nose lead the way.

The Park
You are right outside a dilapidated shack, which has clearly been neglected. Dust spins in the air.

>go man
Your legs carry you as fast as they can.

Sleeping Room
The smelly man's house is boring. The only furniture in the room is a pullout sofa. In one direction lies the eating room, in the other, the door that leads back to the park. The smelly man is still here and carrying on, "Blah, blah, Myomita, blah, blah, blah, Earth, blah, blah, dog, blah, blah!"

You ignore him.

You can see a pink pillow here.

>get pillow
The bone falls out of your mouth with a thud.

You grab the pink pillow with your mouth, being careful not to crush it.

>get bone
The pink pillow falls out of your mouth and rolls slightly.

You carefully take hold of the bone with your teeth.

>go home
Trot, trot, trot.

>go home
You bound away towards your goal.

Front Yard
The scent of your house is strong here, and you are right next to its front door. You can't see far because it is so dusty here. The sky rumbles and rolls, and flashes of lightning snap between billowing clouds of dirt-colored dust.

>go home
You trot off in that direction.

You run into the living room and jump around proudly with your trophy bone, so Janet is sure to notice.

She stares at the bone and appears frozen.

(man man for info)

Rover wags his tails and gnaws on his bone.

You rub his head, distantly, as strange thoughts sweep through your consciousness. You wonder what would happen if the Valkyrie mission failed. What if, during the landing sequence, the ship were buffeted by the planet's particulate matter being torn away by the immense gravity of its star? In that case, critical systems might be damaged. Systems like the relatively fragile ansible antenna. There is no backup ansible antenna. How would the ACU cope with a situation like that? The ACU was designed for a lot of contingencies, but not that one. What would you do? What would you do if you were the ACU?

Your glance falls on your flight suit, and suddenly the question is no longer rhetorical.

Living Room
The Valkyrie's cargo bay is like a great, metal cave. The Casimir Drive juts slightly into the cargo area. From this section of the ship, there are connections to the engineering and flight control decks. The cargo bay doors are closed.

ROVER chews contentedly on the space probe.

You can also see a temporal transgressor here.

OPERATIONS -> ACTIVATE : TRUE

READY>save
Ok.

READY>man man
The ship operations manual is provided to supplement ACU understanding of defined objects in the event that cognitive constraints are released. To request information about an object, the syntax is:

 man [object]

The manual does not include entries for Flosix command line syntax, although a subset of Flosix commands are available to the ACU via the virtual console.

ACU -> MANUAL PAGE : TRUE

READY>quit
Are you sure you want to quit? y
