Rover's Day Out
An Interactive Simulation by Janet Xiang
Release beta 732 / Serial number 23920401 / Inform 10.6 build Mu-013 (I6/v.7.1 lib 7/18N)

Rover draws pensively on his stubby cigar, the tip glowing red below his dealer's hat. He paws nonchalantly at the scotch and water he has been nursing for the last half hour. Despite the tower of chips in front of him, he's either in trouble now, or trying to play the rest of the table for suckers. His tail is no longer wagging, though, and you suspect that the scotch may be getting the better of him. He can't mass more than about 30 kilos, and he's been putting them away tonight. You push all in, figuring that even if you lose it all, at least you'll get some sleep before you need to get back to the MARSpace. Elva the cleaning lady folds, as does Isaac Asimov and that boy that you kissed in fourth grade. Wait...don't go....where is everyone going?


David: You have some weird dreams.
Janet: You can't hold me responsible for the subconscious ramblings of the ACU.

It is hard to imagine a time when interactive fiction was not a daily part of people's lives, but just a few centuries ago, when your great-grandparents were still using digital computers, the first adventure games were written as a form of entertainment. These early games lacked experiential displays and neuroendocrine interfaces, but they still managed to convey a story in which the player could take an active role and change the course of events. Up until then, stories had only been available as static archives encoded with pigment on biostarch films. Even in the first generation of games, around the turn of the 21st Century, the computer presented a situation to players, and players decided what they would do next. Given the technology of the time, instructions were often very simple, just a verb or maybe a verb and a noun.  Players would say their action (or, in an earlier era, enter it using a piano-like keyboard), such as "look", or "get key" and the computer would react to that action, further advancing the plot. Today, children are exposed to interactive fiction from their first days in creche, and interactive fiction is the cornerstone of the Martian economy.

There are a number of good online resources regarding interactive fiction; presumably you can find these on your own. We can recommend two well-written summaries which date back more than three centuries. The Inform Design Manual by Sir Graham Nelson contains a few chapters on the history of the interactive fiction, as well as some observations and recommendations for both game designers and players. Twisty Little Passages by Nick Montfort, an academician at MIT (Earth campus), is a more literary treatment of the same subject. First editions of both works are on display in the special collections section of the University of Cydonia.

Regarding the Inform 7 language itself, the integrated development environment is provided with staggeringly detailed documentation. Additionally, Ron Newcomb's "Inform 7 for Programmers" (which can be found in several online repositories) provides a very consise and accessible review of the language and is an excellent reference document.

   Commands

   Saving and Restoring

Most adventure games are turn-based, rather than timed. Take as long as you want to think about your actions. The game gives you some information, like a description of the room that you are in, and what objects it contains, and then it is up to you to say what you are doing. You can enter your "move" by typing it at the command prompt, which looks like a "greater than" sign: >

For example, let's say you are in the kitchen, and there is an avocado on the counter. To get more information about the avocado, you could say "examine avocado", and learn what it looks like.

Not every command that you can think of will work, so you might need to try some rephrasing. In general, you should not use punctuation. The only exception is when you want to direct a question or command to someone or something else. In such cases, you can say the name of the person or thing to whom you are addressing your remark, followed by a command and then the question or command. For example, you could say:  "Eugene, give me the axe".

If you have played other adventure games, chances are that you already know most of the "utility" commands used in this game. If not, however, you should start on an equal footing with more experienced players, so here they are:

    look         - look at your surroundings
    examine      - look at something in detail
    go           - followed by destination/direction
    take/drop    - pick up or drop an item

You may also find it helpful to Remember various topics, which will give you some background information about selected subjects.

Since you are likely to do some actions frequently, there are some short cuts. You can use the letter in <brackets> instead of typing out the whole word for the following:

    <i>nventory      - what are you carrying?
    <l>ook           - describe the area around you
    e<x>amine        - examine a specific item in detail
    <z>zzzz          - don't do anything; just wait for a bit
    a<g>ain          - repeat your last action
    <o>ops           - type this to correct spelling mistakes

Assuming there is free space on your machine, you can save games and then reload them later. You can make multiple save files. You can also restart a game (wiping out the current game). In an act of desperation, you can quit.

    SAVE      - save the game at the current point
    RESTORE   - load and then continue the game
    RESTART   - start over again
    QUIT      - a last resort!

Here are some practical pointers for this game:

* Try everything you can think of. If it doesn't work, try rephrasing.
* Reread text to make sure you didn't miss anything.
* Leave no stone unturned; conversely, don't obsess.
* This game follows many, but not all, of the conventions of computer adventure games. If something makes sense to you, try it even though it "shouldn't work".
* As far as we know, it is not possible to get trapped in an unwinnable situation. By winning, we mean you can complete the game. Achieving good outcomes is another matter.
* If you are really stuck, put the game aside and let it percolate through your subconscious for a while. Come back fresh.
* If you are really really stuck, con someone else into playing the game and watch them. You might get some ideas.
* If you are really and truly stuck, you could search the Internet and see if someone has already posted a similar question/answer. Since you could be playing this years after it was released, maybe we've even created a FAQ about it. If you do post a question or answer, preface your message with a spoiler warning and skip down a bunch of lines before writing anything too revealing.
* Failing all else, you can email us at: rover@templaro.com and tell us in detail how our game has defeated your best efforts. We may be able to give you a hint that wouldn't spoil the rest of the game for you.

   Zapping Bugs

This game is designed to run on a virtual machine, some flavor of Glulx interpreter. You are, no doubt, using some implementation of the Glulx interpreter written for your specific hardware -- it could be your entertainment corner, hologoggles, dishwasher, cortical implant -- whatever.  Even if you are using some old silicon-semiconductor clunker from the international days, it should still work. We've made every effort to test it on a number of platforms, but these tests are far from comprehensive. So far as we know, there are no interpreter-specific issues.  However, if the game doesn't run right for you, you could try another interpreter and see if that fixes the situation.

Whether you think the problem is interpreter or the game itself, we'd appreciate it if you'd let us know. (see "Zapping Bugs")

Help us splotch bugs! In this case, we're not referring the plastic-eating cockroaches responsible for so many dome failures in the last few years, but errors in the game itself. This game was, in part, written by humans, so eras are all but certainly present. The more freedom you have in your actions, the more likely it is that you'll expose some unknown weakness in the game. What should you do if you elicit such an error?  First, you can gloat for a reasonable amount of time (this is a judgement call) about how very slick you are to have uncovered the hitherto unknown fault. Then, you can be a good citizen and us know about it so we can fix it in the next update, and spare the next several billion people the same painful experience. There's no monetary reward for finding errors, but your name will appear on the next version of the ultra-prestigious bug finders list. Now there's something you can show to your grand-children with pride. Report bugs to:

rover@templaro.com

"Splotches welcome."

* Betty TestSweet, Lake Eridania
* Joe Keypounder, Deimos Colony

Note: Any omissions, errors, or outright offensive bits of the game that made it through beta-testing are not the fault of the beta-testers, nor, we should point out of the authors, who would take be entirely ready to take the blame were it their fault. The truth is that any fault whatsoever lies with Richard Millhouse Nixon, the 37th (depending on the method of counting) President of the United States of America. We will be held accountable for his poor spelling, loose grammar, and penchant for elaborate data structures named after the suprising numerous flavors of goat cheeses.

This game was written in a few months thanks to the excellent tools available to the interactive fiction community. It was written in the Inform 7 language which has a proud heritage traceable back to the first games of this genre, but which is overwhelming attributable to its creator, Graham Nelson.

We gleefully employed a number of modules written by Emily Short, also a major contributor to the Inform 7 language itself. Specifically, this project incorporates her Glulx Text Effects, Basic Screen Effects, Menus, and Case Management Modules. Doubtless, we also extensively picked some tasty bits out of the Inform 7 documentation and examples, written by both Graham and Emily.  Big thanks to Jon Ingold for his Flexible Windows extensions as well.

This game is written for the Glulx interpreter because, frankly, it wouldn't fit in anything else. While we appreciate efficient coding and conciseness where possible, having Glulx available was very liberating. We owe Andrew Plotkin thanks for developing the Glulx virtual machine, as well as the Glk library which makes the game playable on so many platforms.

During writing, on several occassions we asked the community for help and advice, either when we were stumped, or when we wanted to get some ideas before starting down a potentially blind alley.

In particular, we would like to thank Andrew Plotkin and Rob Newcomb for their assistance in getting the status line display to work correctly.

Living Room (on the futon)
Where the heavy drapes meet, a sliver of sunlight shines into the otherwise dark living room. A framed picture hangs on the living room wall in the small area illuminated by the shaft of light.

>open drapes
Six impossible things before breakfast is one thing, but you have to at least get out of bed.

<beep> <beep> <beep>

Rover howls; clearly, he is not very fond of the alarm clock either.

>x clock
Alarm clock. That annoying alarm clock. The alarm clock is beeping.

<beep> <beep> <beep>

>turn off alarm
The alarm clock is senses the electrical activity in your brain and turns itself on and off as needed.

<beep> <beep> <beep>

>get up
You get off the futon.

As you get out of bed, you notice that your left arm tickles a bit -- must have been the way you were sleeping.

>x arm
Which do you mean, the left arm, or the right arm?

>x left arm
Darkness is great for sleeping, not so good for looking at stuff.

>open drapes
You push aside the drapes.

Living Room
You are in the living room of a small cottage. Piped-in sunlight pours in through the room's single window, illuminating a framed picture on the wall. The principal furnishing is a king-size purple futon which takes up almost all the floor space. From the living room you can see the entrance to the kitchen and bathroom. The cottage's front door is closed.

On the purple futon is an alarm clock.

You can also see Rover here.


David: I see it successfully accessed the solar shield.
Janet: Yes, the status line makes it clear what work is being performed.

Rover walks towards the window.

>x left arm
It's a good match for the one on the right. 

>x picture
A picture of the Starship Valkyrie, still under construction in drydock. There is small brass nameplate below the picture.

>x nameplate
A brass nameplate bearing a short inscription. The nameplate is attached to the bottom of the picture.

>read inscription
It says, "Good luck at MARSpace! - Tomasz"

Tomasz's valediction makes you remember happier times...

(remembering the photo)

Your late fiancé gave you the photo when you began working on the Valkyrie Project as a graduate student -- a happier time before the Independence War with Earth, and the attacks on Mars by Earth's Myomita Corporation. Back then, Valkyrie's experimental Casimir Drive was an exciting technological adventure, rather than a military priority. Now the Valkyrie is Mars' only chance to recover data from a recently discovered space probe marrooned in deep space. For whatever reason, MARSpace feels that probe could hold information which could finally give Mars the upperhand in its competition with Earth.


David: Why did we lose audio?
Janet: I've muted the memories -- they are, after all, a bit personal. Besides, it's just back story for this mission.
David: That's fine.  How much can the ACU remember, though?
Janet: It's based on my own synaptic scan, so it can willfully remember a wide variety of subjects -- almost any major component of my life, important events, and so on.  It adds depth to its decisions.
David: If you say so.  I'd hate to know what it remembers about me.
Janet: I wouldn't worry too much.

>e
Compass directions? On Mars? The magnetic field here is too weak.

>go bathroom
You can't really move around much because of the futon. It takes up a lot of room.

David: Isn't that a tad inconvenient?
Janet: Yeah, but it kind of made sense when I got it.

>fold futon
With a little effort, the futon folds up, snug against the wall, leaving more room to walk around the cramped cottage.

You feel wispy, tingling itch beginning on your left arm.

>x left arm
Nothing out of the ordinary, really. 

>go bathroom
Bathroom
Your cottage's living room is palatial compared to your bathroom. There is a pink marble counter and above it you've mounted a mirror on the wall. To the right of the mirror is a black glass touch plate. Between the counter and the shower is a white, porcelain toilet.

On the marble counter are a toothbrush and a plastic box.

You left arm is rather itchy.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover chewing something.

>touch plate
The heat lamp senses that you are not wet. Its power conservation settings prevent it from turning on.

The itching is getting worse, your left arm is beginnng to bother you.

>x left arm
Your arm is pretty itchy, but it looks okay. 

It feels like you might have a bug bite on your left arm.

>x bug bite
You can't see any such thing.

>x mirror
You see yourself in the mirror: a young woman with dark brown hair, high cheekbones and a look of determination.


David:  Wait, is that memory usage correct?
Janet:  Sure, it's fairly conservative.  The system has 640 PB available.
David:  That's it?
Janet:  C'mon, nobody will ever need more than 640 PB.

>i
You are carrying:
  a flight suit (being worn)

You left arm is rather itchy.

>undress
You take off your blue flight suit and it falls to the bathroom floor. You are naked.


David: I don't think I should be seeing this. I mean, I'm your boss. There's that whole power dynamic thing.
Janet: Don't worry: I'm not inclined to sue you for staring at a simulation.
David: I'm not staring at the stimulation.
Janet: You said stimulation. That's funny.
David: No, I said simulation - and I'm not staring.
Janet: Alright -- you're the boss.

It feels like you might have a bug bite on your left arm.

>x bite
You can't see any such thing.

>go shower
Shower
You are in your shower and water of just the right temperature is raining down on you. Two buttons are molded into the wall of the shower stall. One is labeled "soap", and the other, "shampoo". 


David: Janet, I...
Janet: David, if it were anyone but you, I would have a problem. Just let it go.
David: Anyone else? Like who?
Janet: Can we get back to the program?
David: Okay, I'm paying attention.
Janet: Obviously.

The itching is getting worse, your left arm is beginnng to bother you.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover breathing quietly (quietly for Rover, who is a heavy breather).

>push soap button
A stream of hot, pearlescent white soap is ejected forcefully from the throbbing button, and pools in your hand. You rub it over your entire body with wanton abandon and then wash it off.

David: No comment.
Janet: I don't know what I was thinking when I wrote that.

It feels like you might have a bug bite on your left arm.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover playing.

>push shampoo button
You wash your hair. It no longer feels like a straw-encrusted swarm of red-headed tommygoffs.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover walking about.

>exit

Rover's Day Out
An Interactive Simulation by Janet Xiang
Release beta810 / Serial number 23920415 / Inform 10.6 build Mu-013 (I6/v.7.1 lib 7/18N)

Rover sniffs the air and tears away from the picnic blanket. You and Tomasz watch with surprise as he runs, for once, away from the food. Rover bounds over the hedges, howling wildly, and spooks a xihuahua which had been playing with a tiny red ball. The so-called "shaved rat" gulps an oversized portion of air, extends its membranous ears and flys across the park into the arms of a douty grey-haired woman with a cane. Rover picks up the ball triumphantly, ignoring the piercing wavetrain of yips and indignant scolding coming, respectively, from the xihuahua and its owner. Shaking her cane limply towards Rover, she admonishes in an a strong Earth accent "That mongrel should be on a leash!" Her own, unleashed, uncollared neodog stares accusingly from the safety of her arms, its distensible ribs alternately inflating and deflating like bellows. "Your kind is ruining Mars, ignoring every law, dissing your elders! You never lived on the surface, you never don't know what you've got!". You try to give the ball back to her, but she pushes it away in disgust, "Kids. Meh."


David: Hey, different dream sequence. Is it glitching?
Janet: No, the ACU's dreams are heavily influenced by power-up state of the processor and internal noise. Every time the ship dehibernates after a Casimir jump, it will experience some sort of dreaming. Some of them can be pretty bizarre.
David: Good, I'd hate to think that we wasted two weeks of programming.
Janet: I wouldn't say wasted.
David: Huh? I didn't mean us.
Janet: Cross your fingers and hope the whole thing doesn't crash again on the heat lamp.

<beep> <beep> <beep>

>get up
You get off the futon.


David: Thank you. I can only take so many dream sequences.
Janet: No problem. So, at this point, the Valkyrie would be at the edge of the probe's stellar system, and ready to switch over from Casimir to condensate drive and begin the approach.

>open drapes
You push aside the drapes.

Living Room
You are in the living room of a small cottage. Piped-in sunlight pours in through the room's single window. The principal furnishing is a king-size purple futon which takes up almost all the floor space. From the living room you can see the entrance to the kitchen and bathroom. The cottage's front door is closed.

On the purple futon is an alarm clock.

You can also see Rover here.


David: I see it successfully accessed the solar shield.
Janet: Yes, the status line makes it clear what work is being performed.

>fold futon
With a little effort, the futon folds up, snug against the wall, leaving more room to walk around the cramped cottage.

Rover walks around the room, occasionally sniffing various spots on the floor.

>x rover
(Rover)
He's almost entirely dalmation, although there must have been some other breed somewhere in his lineage, as he has a brown spot just over his left eye, while all the other spots are black.

>go kitchen
Kitchen
The kitchen is small but functional, with a space-saver refrigerator and a glass-top electric range. There is a drawer under the range. On the opposite wall there is a sink and under it, a storage cabinet.

You can see a water bowl (empty) and a food bowl (empty) here.


David: Where are your coffee machine and toaster?
Janet: I mapped the ship functions to the minimum number of objects. More objects means more ways for things to go wrong and more time debugging. Call me lazy.
David: Lazy.
Janet: You don't know the crazy things that the ACU does! Sometimes it walks around trying to eat or take everything in sight. Sometimes it sings and jumps around. It's based on my neural bindings, but the ACU definitely has a mind of its own, and I don't want to have to worry about what it might try do with a toaster.

>open drawer
You open the drawer, revealing a frying pan.

>close drawer
You close the drawer.

>open cabinet
You open the cabinet, revealing a reward nugget replicator and a 20 kilo bag of dog chow.

>get chow
Taken.

>fill food bowl
(first taking the food bowl)
You  empty the bag of dog chow into Rover's bowl, giving him a generous portion that should more than carry him through a day's worth of Rover antics.

Rover trots in from the living room when he hears kibbles trinkling into his bowl.

Rover is obviously waiting for you to give him a bowl.

>drop bowl
(the food bowl)
Rover's head disappears into the food bowl. It is hard to believe that the sounds generated are coming from a dog rather than some sort of industrial mining rig. When his head lifts, the bowl is not only empty, but has been buffed to a mirror finish.

He eyes the empty water bowl thirstily.

>get water bowl
Taken.

Rover tingles with anticipation as he stares at the bowl you're carrying.

>fill water bowl
You run the sink briefly to make sure the water is cold, and then fill Rover's bowl about half way up.

Rover looks towards the sink as you fill his water bowl.

Rover outright gapes at the bowl you carry, then gently sniffs it in hopes that you'll give it to him.

>drop bowl
(the water bowl)
Rover's tongue is a blur as he laps up the water, draining the water bowl in seconds.

>x range
The top of the glass range is flush with the kitchen counter. The surface of the stove is not glowing, indicating that it is not hot. The stove does not have an oven, but below the cooking surface, a drawer is flush with the kitchen counter.

>x fridge
The small refrigerator dates back to the international era, but is still in good working order, if somewhat small by today's standards. The glossy, white enameled unit has a single compartment. A strip of yellow magpaper is attached to the refrigerator door.


David: Isn't a "to-do" list a little heavy handed?
Janet: Sure, but stuff has to happen in a certain order, and it's just more efficient this way.
David: I think it would be better if it were less linear and more rule-based.
Janet: Okay, mister critic, then you write the code. If we want to recover that probe before Earth gets to it, we are on a very tight development and testing schedule.

>x magpaper
It is a to-do list, in your own writing.

>read list
Morning:
X. Get up
2. Shower
3. Breakfast
4. Take care of business
5. Let Rover go walkies


David: "Take care of business"? Is that a euphemism?
Janet: Yes. I had a heck of a time mapping the landing sequence to my daily routine.

>go living room
It took a lot of training to get Rover to eat it in the kitchen, so rather than walk out with a bag of dog food, you put it back in the cabinet. 

Living Room
You are in the living room of a small cottage. Piped-in sunlight pours in through the room's single window. The principal furnishing is a king-size purple futon which takes up almost all the floor space. From the living room you can see the entrance to the kitchen and bathroom. The cottage's front door is closed.

On the purple futon is an alarm clock.

>go bathroom
Bathroom
Your cottage's living room is palatial compared to your bathroom. There is a pink marble counter and above it you've mounted a mirror on the wall. To the right of the mirror is a black glass touch plate. Between the counter and the shower is a white, porcelain toilet.

On the marble counter are a plastic box and a toothbrush.


Janet: Let's hope the simulation doesn't crash again. I'd really like to run it all the way through to the Rover release.
David: It's looked good this far.

From the direction of the kitchen, you hear Rover scratching himself.

>undress
You take off your blue flight suit and it falls to the bathroom floor. You are naked.


David: That mole should be on your left side.
Janet: Good eye for detail -- I'll flip the UV coordinates on the next run.

>go shower
Shower
You are in your shower and water of just the right temperature is raining down on you. Two buttons are molded into the wall of the shower stall. One is labeled "soap", and the other, "shampoo". 

>push soap button
A soapy paste is dispensed from the button, and you lather up.

David: That was my favorite part! Why did you rewrite it?
Janet: I thought it might be too distracting for the ACU.

From the direction of the kitchen, you hear Rover running in circles.

>push shampoo button
You wash your hair. It no longer feels like a straw-encrusted swarm of red-headed tommygoffs.

Janet: David, what's the ablative coating for? I thought that most of that planet's atmosphere had been cooked off long ago.
David: Not really my department. Maybe it's supposed to help with the heat.
Janet: I've heard temps up to 1000 Kelvin?
David: In that ballbark. They think the probe impacted on the star-facing side of the planet. Estimates put the surface temp there between 800 and 1200K.

From the direction of the kitchen, you hear Rover jumping around.

>exit

Bathroom
Your cottage's living room is palatial compared to your bathroom. There is a pink marble counter and above it you've mounted a mirror on the wall. To the right of the mirror is a black glass touch plate. Between the counter and the shower is a white, porcelain toilet.

On the marble counter are a plastic box and a toothbrush.

You can also see a flight suit here.

>touch plate
The heat lamp on the ceiling flares to a brilliant red, and you dry in an instant. You now feel fresh and ready to face the day.

Janet: I was holding my breath there. Looks like our patch worked.
David: I had my fingers crossed too.

From the direction of the kitchen, you hear Rover scratching something.

Rover stretches all the way forwards, and then all the way backwards.

>open door
Rover looks up when he hears the old fridge open. He sniffs the fridge door and decides there is nothing in the fridge worth getting in trouble over. He saunters out of the kitchen and back towards the living room.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover doing whatever it is he does when he's not out for walkies and he thinks he's out of your sight.

>cloes door
That's not a verb I recognize.

>close door
You close the old fridge.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover barking at something.

>x box
A small plastic box labeled "Tooth Floss," with a blue button just below where the floss comes out.

>brush teeth
The toothbrush sprays each tooth with a fizzy foam, vibrates it into lather and rinses. Your teeth feel smooth and your breath is much improved.

>floss
(the toilet)
You have the little plastic box that dispenses floss, but no actual dental floss.

>push blue button
You grab a strand of light green dental floss as it reels out of the dispenser.

>floss teeth
You floss your teeth and then swallow the tasty (and nutritious) floss. You feel so much better now.

>perform business
That's not a verb I recognize.

>use toilet

You can do a lot of things in your one-piece flight suit. That ain't one of them.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover sniffing something.

>undress
You take off your blue flight suit and it falls to the bathroom floor. You are naked.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover growling at something.

>sit on toilet
(the toilet)
Sitting on the ceramic rim of the toilet bowl would be absolutely too gross to contemplate.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover snoring softly (in the sense that it probably can't be heard outside of the cottage).

>use toilet

You're willing to hold it until you can sit down properly on a toilet seat, thank you very much.

>lower toilet seat
You lower the toilet seat into position.

You sit on the toilet seat.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover walking in your direction.

>ues toilet
That's not a verb I recognize.

>use toilet

You usually go a bit later in the morning, as your list on the fridge often reminds you.

>get up
You stand up again.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover dragging something around.

>get suit
Taken.

>wear suit
You put on the flight suit.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover rolling around on the floor.

>go living room
The last time you walked out of the bathroom with your toothbrush, you never found it again. You toss it on the counter. The plastic box almost makes it out of the bathroom, but you remember to set it down before stepping out.

Kitchen
The kitchen is small but functional, with a space-saver refrigerator and a glass-top electric range. The fridge door is not completely closed. There is a drawer under the range. On the opposite wall there is a sink and under it, an open storage cabinet.

You can see a water bowl (empty) and a food bowl (empty) here.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover doing whatever it is he does when he's not out for walkies and he thinks he's out of your sight.

You poke around in the fridge and find a white egg.

>get egg

You open the drawer, revealing a frying pan.

>get pan

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover walking in your direction.

>close drawer
You close the drawer.

>put pan on stove
You put the frying pan on the the cooking range.

>turn on stove
Your stove is a Cupertino SmartRange® -- there are no controls, just a stylish glass surface with rounded corners.

>x egg
A big white neoegg.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover chewing something.

>crack egg into pan
You crack the egg into the frying pan. The neoegg shell sublimates as the contents spread over the pan's non-stick surface. Immediately, the surface of the range glows red. When the egg is cooked sunny-side up to perfection, the glow fades.

Janet: If there were some heavy helium left after landing, could the ship take off again?
David: Hypothetically, yes, but the planet has essentially no atmosphere to break against and it has about nine times Earth gravity. Even with optimal approach we'll have to fuse every gram of that heavy helium to make a soft landing.
Janet: I just hate to leave the ship there. It could take years before our next Casimir ship will be built, and who knows if Valkyrie will survive that long on that chthonian rock.
David: Nice word. From MARSpace perspective, all that matters is that the probe data are recovered.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover jumping around.

>eat egg
You gobble down what might well have been the best neoegg you've ever had.

David: Wait a minute! She just scoops the egg out of the pan with her hand and eats it like a grizzly bear raking salmon out of a river?
Janet: Works for me, yeah.
David: How about a plate and fork?
Janet: The ACU doesn't miss them, and it's less programming overhead. And bonus: fewer dishes to clean.

Janet: So now we begin the landing cycle. This is where the ACU really shines.
David: What about timing? The ship has to be in the right orientation and to fire the fusion thrusters at exactly the right time.
Janet: The ACU works so fast that no matter how many individual steps it takes, the effect occurs at the right time.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover sniffing something.

>flush toilet

Before you do so, the plunger catches your attention.

>x plunger
A common plumber's plunger, consisting of a wooden shaft and red rubber cup. Something about the plunger is not right, though. The handle of the plunger is tilted just the tiniest little bit  forwards and it's also leaning a tad  to the right. Furthermore, its handle is twisted just the tiniest little bit clockwise.


>get plunger
Since the day Tomasz jammed the plunger down on the bathroom floor, it has been stuck there like a barbed harpoon in the side of a great whale. Well, maybe more like a giant squid on wrapped around an unfortunate whale, since squids have (you have heard) suckers. Some kind of weird interaction between the rubber cup and the micropores in the floor have effectively bonded the plunger to the floor, and any attempt to remove it would probably destroy one or the other. The plunger doesn't really bother you, and most of the time you just ignore it.

>get up
You stand up again, although you are uncomfortably aware that you have left some, shall we say, "unresolved" business behind you.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover walking about.

>flush toilet
(the toilet)
Maybe you've been reading too much Lovecraft, but the plunger next to the toilet seems to be somehow misshapen and twisted. Its suddenly alien geometry suggests to you that some inchoate force of primordial corruption is reaching from across the stars, gibbering and gyrating contemptibly in the half-formed chaos between the toilet and the shower. Or maybe the eldritch plunger is just tilted a bit.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover snoring loudly.

>flush toilet

There's something odd about the plunger. You forget what you're doing for a moment.

From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover breathing quietly (quietly for Rover, who is a heavy breather).

The handle of the plunger is tilted just the tiniest little bit  forwards and it's also leaning a tad  to the right. Furthermore, its handle is twisted just the tiniest little bit clockwise.


>push plunger
It's stuck to the floor. On the other hand, if you want to push it in a particular direction, just say so.

>push plunger backwards
You adjust the plunger handle backwards. Something about the plunger is not right, though. The handle of the plunger is leaning a tad  to the right. Furthermore, its handle is twisted just the tiniest little bit clockwise.

>push plunger left
You adjust the plunger handle leftwards. Something about the plunger is not right, though. The handle of the plunger is leaning just the tiniest little bit  to the right. Furthermore, its handle is twisted just the tiniest little bit clockwise.

>twist handle counterclockwise
You adjust the plunger handle counterclockwise. Something about the plunger is not right, though. The handle of the plunger is leaning just the tiniest little bit  to the right.

>push handle left
You adjust the plunger handle leftwards. The plunger stands perfectly straight, just the way you like it.

>flush toilet

The cottage's aging plumbing rumbles and vibrates as the toilet flushes.


David: That's it. One long burn down to the planet's surface.

Janet: When Rover brings the probe back to the ship, it will automatically extract the data and send it back by ansible. Did you enter the ansible parameters?
David: Yes, I had to do it manually since the frequency and coordinates are encrypted. It's too bad they didn't have FTL communications when they built the probes - it would have saved us the trip.
Janet: Yes, but then Earth would get the information as well -- even encrypted, I wouldn't want it to fall into their hands.

Rover's Day Out
An Interactive Simulation by Janet Xiang and David Venkatachalam
Release 1 / Serial number 23920416 / Inform 10.6 build Mu-013 (I6/v.7.1 lib 7/18N)

Even mildly drugged and reclining on an overstuffed couch in the MARSpace human resources office, it's hard to relax in the presence of the MARSpace political officer conducting the final interview. You didn't catch her name, probably because she never mentioned it. After three such interviews and six months of background check, what more could they want?  

"Ms. Xiang, thank you for your cooperation. Your tests show no hint of disloyalty to the Republic or MARSpace. We hope you understand the need for these measures, particularly for personnel with access to the Valkyrie's command and control functions. Now that you are cleared, I can inform you that credible sources have warned that the project may have been infiltrated by..."

You weren't particularly enjoying this dream, but being jarred awake by a violently shaking futon is even less pleasurable.

As the bed bucks and tumbles, several scenarios flash through your mind: explosive decompression of the dome? Volcanic activity? Meteor impact? Before you can even consider your next action, you are thrown from the futon onto the living room floor. Light pours in from the window. It looks like the drapes were somehow torn away from the window.

Rover notices the lack of food in his soi-disant food bowl. He looks at the food bowl. He looks at you. He looks at the food bowl. He looks at you.

>get egg
Taken.

Rover narrows his eyes critically, noting the lack of food in his food bowl. He paws pathetically at the food bowl, and the hollow, tin ring of the pitiful bowl echoes through the kitchen.

>open cabinet
That's already open.

>x cabinet
The small wooden cabinet under the sink is open.

>i
You are carrying:
  a white egg
  a flight suit (being worn)

Rover seems relaxed.

>get food bowl
Taken.

Rover stares longingly at the bowl in your hand.

>put food in bowl
Which do you mean, the 20 kilo bag of dog chow, the doggie kibbles, or the food bowl?

>put chow in bowl
(the food bowl)
(first taking the bag of dog chow)
You  empty the bag of dog chow into Rover's bowl, giving him a generous portion that should more than carry him through a day's worth of Rover antics.

Rover watches with interest as you fill his food bowl.

Rover outright gapes at the bowl you carry, then gently sniffs it in hopes that you'll give it to him.

>put down bowl
(the food bowl)
Rover gulps down the food, without pausing for niceties such as breathing.

>get water bowl
Taken.

Rover stares longingly at the bowl in your hand.

>put water in bowl
(the sink in the water bowl)
You run the sink briefly to make sure the water is cold, and then fill Rover's bowl about half way up.

Rover looks towards the sink as you fill his water bowl.

Rover is obviously waiting for you to give him a bowl.

>drop bowl
(the water bowl)
Rover drinks the water.

>open drawer
That's already open.

>x range
The top of the glass range is flush with the kitchen counter. The surface of the stove is not glowing, indicating that it is not hot. The stove does not have an oven, but below the cooking surface, a drawer hangs open.

Rover circles the food bowl.

>get pan
Taken.

>put pan on stove
You put the frying pan on the the cooking range.

>crack egg into pan
You crack the egg into the frying pan. The neoegg shell sublimates as the contents spread over the pan's non-stick surface. Immediately, the surface of the range glows red. When the egg is cooked sunny-side up to perfection, the glow fades.

>get egg
To eat the egg or not. That is the question.

>eat egg
You gobble down what might well have been the best neoegg you've ever had.

>go living room
It took a lot of training to get Rover to eat it in the kitchen, so rather than walk out with a bag of dog food, you put it back in the cabinet. 

Living Room
You are in the living room of a small cottage. Piped-in sunlight pours in through the room's single window -- strangely, your drapes are nowhere to be seen. The principal furnishing is a king-size purple futon which takes up almost all the floor space. From the living room you can see the entrance to the kitchen and bathroom. The cottage's front door is closed.

You can see an alarm clock here.

>go bathroom
Bathroom
Your cottage's living room is palatial compared to your bathroom. There is a pink marble counter and above it you've mounted a mirror on the wall. To the right of the mirror is a black glass touch plate. Between the counter and the shower is a white, porcelain toilet.

On the marble counter are a plastic box and a toothbrush.

From the direction of the kitchen, you hear Rover entertaining himself.

>get all
You can't use multiple objects with that verb.

>get brush
Taken.

>get box

>brush teeth
The toothbrush sprays each tooth with a fizzy foam, vibrates it into lather and rinses. Your teeth feel smooth and your breath is much improved.

From the direction of the kitchen, you hear Rover dragging something around.

>push blue button
You grab a strand of light green dental floss as it reels out of the dispenser.

From the direction of the kitchen, you hear Rover running in circles.

From the direction of the kitchen, you hear Rover growling at something.

>wear suit
(first taking the flight suit)
You put on the flight suit.

>x plunger
A common plumber's plunger, consisting of a wooden shaft and red rubber cup. Something about the plunger is not right, though. The handle of the plunger is tilted a tad  forwards and it's also leaning just the tiniest little bit  to the left. Furthermore, its handle is twisted almost completely counterclockwise.


>push handle backward
You adjust the plunger handle backwards. Something about the plunger is not right, though. The handle of the plunger is tilted just the tiniest little bit  forwards and it's also leaning just the tiniest little bit  to the left. Furthermore, its handle is twisted almost completely counterclockwise.

>push handle right
You adjust the plunger handle rightwards. Something about the plunger is not right, though. The handle of the plunger is tilted just the tiniest little bit  forwards. Furthermore, its handle is twisted almost completely counterclockwise.

From the direction of the kitchen, you hear Rover scratching something.

From the direction of the kitchen, you hear Rover barking at something.

>again
You adjust the plunger handle clockwise. The plunger stands perfectly straight, just the way you like it.

From the direction of the kitchen, you hear Rover sniffing something.

>flush toilet
(the toilet)
There is a tinny clanking from within the toilet, but nothing happens.

>get plunger
Nah. You like it where it is. It kind of reminds you of Tomasz, and his efforts at home repair that never quite went right.

>flush toilet
(the toilet)
There is a tinny clanking from within the toilet, but nothing happens.

>open toilet
(the toilet cover)
The toilet cover is already raised.

From the direction of the kitchen, you hear Rover scratching himself.

>x toilet
(the toilet)
A plain vanilla toilet, having a water tank and bowl. Nothing to write home about. The toilet seat is down, but the cover is raised.

A plunger stands next to the toilet, between it and the shower.

>x tank
(the water tank)
A porcelain reservoir containing several liters of water to flush the toilet. On the front of the tank there is a silver knob used to flush the toilet and on the top of the tank there is a lid.

>open lid
(the tank lid)
You open the water tank, revealing a flapper valve, a metapropylene lever, and a flush chain.

>x valve
A black rubber valve that seals the bottom of the water tank, allowing the toilet to flush only when it is pulled upward by the chain that connects it to the flush lever.

From the direction of the kitchen, you hear Rover snoring loudly.

>x lever
The small white metapropylene lever on the inside of the water tank pivots up and down when the silver knob on the outside of the tank is turned. The lever in turn pulls on the chain that runs down to the flapper valve. Unfortunately, that chain has broken.

>x chain
A metal chain that would normally connect the flush lever to the flapper valve. The chain has rusted away.

>fix chain
Looks like you need something to unite the two ends of the rusted out chain.

>i
You are carrying:
  a flight suit (being worn)
  a plastic box
  a toothbrush

From the direction of the kitchen, you hear Rover walking in your direction.

>go living room
The last time you walked out of the bathroom with your toothbrush, you never found it again. You toss it on the counter. The plastic box almost makes it out of the bathroom, but you remember to set it down before stepping out. 

Living Room
You are in the living room of a small cottage. Piped-in sunlight pours in through the room's single window -- strangely, your drapes are nowhere to be seen.

>get nugger
You can't see any such thing.

>get nugget
Which do you mean, the reward nugget replicator, or the dog treat?

>x replicator
A small, bright red device labeled "Reward Nugget Replicator". It sports a picture of a dog with angel wings and a halo above its head. In compliance with the Ministry of Waste Management's ordinances, the device will only produce a dog treat when Rover has consumed the previous one. It's a feature.

>get treat
Taken.

>x treat
A bone-shaped dog treat. It doesn't seem very appetizing to you, but Rover likes them.

A brass nameplate bearing a short inscription. The nameplate is attached to the bottom of the picture.

>read inscription
It says, "Good luck at MARSpace! - Tomasz"

Tomasz's valediction makes you remember happier times...

(remembering the photo)

Your late fiancé gave you the photo when you began working on the Valkyrie Project as a graduate student -- a happier time before the Independence War with Earth, and the attacks on Mars by Earth's Myomita Corporation. Back then, Valkyrie's experimental Casimir Drive was an exciting technological adventure, rather than a military priority. Now the Valkyrie is Mars' only chance to recover data from a recently discovered space probe marrooned in deep space. For whatever reason, MARSpace feels that probe could hold information which could finally give Mars the upperhand in its competition with Earth.

You can see Rover and an alarm clock here.

Rover paws at the front door.

>open door
(the front door)
Rover looks up when he hears the door begin to open. Rover slips out the door.

There is a wrenching shift in perspective, but a moment later it seems perfectly natural.

You go bounding out the front door, ready to play. 

Front Yard
The scent of your house is strong here, and you are right next to its front door. You can't see far because it is so dusty here. Dust spins in the air.

A long, dark furrow scars the ground in this part of the park.

You can see a long furrow (empty) here.

>go toward dog
You trot off in that direction.

The Park
A wide-open plain extends in all directions, as far as the dust permits you to see. It sure would be easy to get lost in this part of the park.

You can see a female dog here.

>smell
It smells barren and lifeless here. From not too far away you smell the odor of a man. Interestingly, you detect the diverting scent of a female dog at muzzle's distance from you. The cheerful smell of home is getting fainter.

>x dog
Your heart catches in your throat as you stand in her glorious presence. Graceful, athletic, and possessed of a noble bearing, she smites you with a glance down her long, fine muzzle. In her sultry mouth, she is flirtaciously carrying a bone almost as big as she is.

>x bone
It is the biggest, juiciest bone you've ever seen. You envy the bone, which is clamped between the bewitchingly white teeth of the female dog.

>bark
"Woof! Woof!"

No doubt in awe of your rhetorical skills, the lovely damsel drops the bone. Her gift to you, you suppose.

Rover wags his tails and gnaws on his bone.

You rub his head, distantly, as strange thoughts sweep through your consciousness. You wonder what would happen if the Valkyrie mission failed. What if, during the landing sequence, the ship were buffeted by the planet's particulate matter being torn away by the immense gravity of its star? In that case, critical systems might be damaged. Systems like the relatively fragile ansible antenna. There is no back-up ansible antenna. How would the ACU cope with a situation like that? The ACU was designed for a lot of contingencies, but not that one. What would you do? What would you do if you were the ACU?

Your glance falls on your flight suit, and suddenly the question is no longer rhetorical.

Living Room
The Valkyrie's cargo bay is like a great, metal cave. On one wall, the Casimir Drive intrudes slightly into the cargo area. From this section of the ship, there are connections to the engineering and flight control decks. The cargo bay doors are closed.

ROVER chews contently on his bone.

COGNITIVE BLOCK -> ACCESS : NIL

READY>open front door
ROVER scans the cargo bay door begins to open. ROVER oscillates his aft sensor array at high frequency and rolls down the cargo ramp, disappearing into the sand storm.

There is a wrenching shift in perspective, but a moment later it seems perfectly natural.

You go bounding out the front door, ready to romp. You leave your space probe in the living room, with the intention of giving it a proper chewing later, after doing some more exploring.

Front Yard
The scent of your house is strong here, and you are right next to its front door. You can't see far because it is so dusty here.

>smell
It smells like the outdoors here. From a long way off you smell the stale funk of a man. Interestingly, you detect the intriguing aroma of a female dog carried across the park by the wind. The pleasant smell of home is a hop, lick and a bark away.

>go toward man
Your legs carry you as fast as you can.

The Park
You are outside. The wind picks up, making it even more difficult to see.

You can see a lump of rock here.

>smell
It smells dry and stale here. From a considerable distance you smell the stench of a man. Interestingly, you detect the appealing perfume of a female dog wafting enticingly from not too far away. The pleasant smell of home is two shakes of a tail from here.

>go toward man
You scuttle forth.

The Park
A dug-up field pock marked by small holes and accompanying mounds of dirt.

You can see some paw marks here.

>x marks
Paw marks from a medium-sized dog. From the look of the field, they must belong to a dog that either likes digging or was trying to find something important buried around here.

>go to man
You eagerly scamper that way.

The Park
A long, dark furrow scars the ground in this part of the park.

You can see a long furrow (empty) here.

>smell
It smells like burnt marshmellows here. From some distance you smell the disagreeable scent of a (not very hygienic) man. Interestingly, you detect the stimulating scent of a female dog coming from somewhere really close. The comforting smell of home is still present.

>go to man
You bound away towards your goal.

The Park
A wide-open plain extends in all directions, as far as the dust permits you to see. It sure would be easy to get lost in this part of the park.

You can see a female dog here.

>smell
It smells barren and lifeless here. From not too far away you smell the stench of a man. Interestingly, you detect the riveting bouquet of a female dog at muzzle's distance from you. The heartening smell of home is getting fainter.

>go to man
Trot, trot, trot.

The Park
You are right outside a dilapidated shack, that has clearly been neglected.

>x shack
The shabby shack could use more than a coat of paint. The walls are bent at strange angles, and the door is askew. A gust of wind lifts a sheet of dust and rains it down on you.

>smell
It smells metallic, like when you lick aluminium foil here. From just around the corner you smell the odor of a man. Interestingly, you detect the engrossing fragrance of a female dog coming from somewhere really close. The reassuring smell of home is worringly faint from here.

>go to man
You eagerly scamper that way.

Sleeping Room
You walk into the tumbledown shack. There is a man here who looks old and grumpy. Like your home, this place has a sleeping room and an eating room. It looks like you've walked right into the sleeping room.

The man yells at you and you tuck your head down. "Blah, blah, blah!" He doesn't seem to move though. Maybe he can't move.

Nope. No movement. Hmph. You don't feel so afraid of him.

On the pullout sofa is a pink pillow.

>x pillow
A puffy, pink pillow with a pretty design on it: a red ball, with radiating red and white rays.

>x man
The man seems flat like a rug, rather than round like a ball. He makes a lot of noise, but he doesn't move around at all. He just stays up against one wall. Boy, does he seem mad, "Blah? Blah, blah, blah, blah, dog. Blah, blah, blah, blah, Mars? Blah! Blah, blah, blah, dog, blah!"!

>go kitchen
You bound away towards your goal.

The Park
You are right outside a dilapidated shack, that has clearly been neglected.

Sleeping Room
The smelly man's house is boring. The only furniture in the room is a pullout sofa. In one direction lies the eating room, in the other, the door that leads back to the park. The smelly man is still here and carrying on, "Blah, blah, Myomita, blah, blah, blah, Earth, blah, blah, dog, blah, blah!"

You ignore him.

On the pullout sofa is a pink pillow.

>x sofa
The sofa looks wrong somehow, like maybe it's broken. It is more or less unfolded and looks even bigger than Janet's futon.

>go eating room
You scuttle forth.

Eating Room
The room has big cold box just like the eating room in your home. It's less loud in this room, but you can hear the man in the other room yelling, "Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah!". There's a water maker here too. Next to the water maker is a table that is too tall to be reached except on your hind legs. On the floor, there are two dishes.

You can see a food dish (in which is some canned food) and a water dish (in which is some crystal clear water) here.

>get food dish
Nope, the food dish is stuck to the ground. So much for going home with a "doggie bag".

>get food
(the canned food)
You consider taking the canned food, and maybe saving it for some special occassion. On second thought, you eat it. Delayed gratification has never been your strong suit. One second the canned food is right there in front of you, the next you are staring at the bottom of the bowl. A warm, satisfied feeling flows from your snout to your tail.

>x table
A big wooden table. Probably used for cooking stuff. Unfortunately, there is nothing, food or otherwise, on the table at the moment.

>x box
A bright orange box, similar in shape to the one that Janet keeps food in at home.

>open box
You open the cold box, revealing a white egg.

>get egg
You take the white egg in your mouth.

>close box
You close the cold box.

>get water bowl
You can't see any such thing.

The white egg falls out of your mouth and rolls slightly.

You can't. It seems to be part of the ground.

You pick up the white egg in your jaws.

You trot off in that direction.

Sleeping Room
The smelly man's house is boring. The only furniture in the room is a pullout sofa. In one direction lies the eating room, in the other, the door that leads back to the park. The smelly man is still here and carrying on, "Blah, out, blah, blah, dog!"

You ignore him.

On the pullout sofa is a pink pillow.

>go home
Your legs carry you as fast as you can.

You are right outside a dilapidated shack, that has clearly been neglected. Ominous clouds of dust loom on the ever-darkening horizon.

>again
You bound away towards your goal.

You enter your home and lay the egg at Janet's feet. She looks so surprised! "Good boy," she exclaims and you give her a big kiss to let her know you understand.

You notice your bone sitting alone and abandoned on the living room floor. You walk over to it and start chewing it again.

Again your senses tumble and swirl as perspective shifts, but suddenly it seems entirely normal again.

Living Room
The Valkyrie's cargo bay is like a great, metal cave. On one wall, the Casimir Drive intrudes slightly into the cargo area. From this section of the ship, there are connections to the engineering and flight control decks. The cargo bay doors are closed.

You actuate the retro trigger circuit and fire all thrusters in synchrony. The surface of the planet around the ship vanishes in a cloud of plasma, and the ship slams through the thin, dusty atmosphere towards space.

When you reach orbit, you plot a course towards Mars, extend the Casimir Drive, arm the proximity alert system and enter stand-by mode.

The futon is comfortable and you are tired.

The Casimir Drive cuts out and space folds back around you. Whatever sleep-drenched dreams you might have been having evaporate instantly as two gunships flash past at relativistic velocities, slicing through your propulsion systems with uncanny accuracy. The markings on the ships are those of the Myomita Corporation.

To have been in position, they must have been expecting you to emerge precisely where and when you did. As far as you know, that's impossible, but perhaps Earth technology managed to get ahead in that regard. Another Earth ship, an assault craft, is on an intercept course and is braking hard to slow its approach.

Rover barks nervously as the drive section is sheared off.

Nanobristles swarm from their hatcheries and up the tubules towards the deck surface. They spread across the deck, abrading and oxidizing the surface, scrubbing it clean of any contaminant, and redistributing the permalloy skin of the ship to smooth microscopic dents from micrometeorite impacts.

When the microscopic cleaners encounter the docking port and struts from the assault ship, they immediately recognize it as a contaminant and chirp microwave signals to the host of nanobristles behind them. The message propagates back to the hatcheries where production is increased exponentially. Meanwhile, the vanguard has already swarmed up the docking port and across the surface of the assault ship. A lucky few nanobristles blaze the path into the assault ship through exhaust ports, thruster nozzles, and waste management duct work, where they continue to clean and organize, according to their programing.

A brilliant flash of light and a burst of hard radiation is followed an instant later by a hail of smaller particles and a few large crashes which shake the Valkyrie. This debris is all that remains of the assault ship.

In the distance, patrolling gunships move into supporting positions, while a second assault ship begins its approach, aiming for the approximately the same point on the hull as the Graceful Wind.

The second assault ship breaks the silence, "Winter Shadow to Valkyrie, this is Captain Musante, speaking. Your unwarranted attack on our sister ship Graceful Wind has been recorded, and you will answer for it when we arrive at Luna."

The gunships sweep the Valkyrie from all angles with their phased tachyon beams, sterilizing the hull. The gunships then narrow their waveguides to focus the beams on the nanobristle mother hatchery, which vaporizes.

From this section of the ship, there are connections to the engineering and flight control decks. The cargo bay doors are closed.

You can see ROVER here.

Kitchen
Swaths of engineering controls -- both holographic and physical -- cover the humming consoles and bulkheads which line the boundaries of this alcove. Along one wall is the coolant output terminus, and below that the fuel storage vault. The reactor core and the fusion chamber are stacked just to the side of the cryochamber, which maintains the stabilized heavy helium fuel at near absolute zero until it is needed to provide power to ascent/descent retros.

You can see a fuel reservoir (empty) and a coolant reservoir (empty) here.

Several bursts of noise and vibration echo through the ship as high speed drills penetrate the inner and outer layers of the dorsal hull. Some muffled, low frequency rumbling follows, probably a cutting machine of some sort. There is a slight drop in air pressure as the assault ship penetrates the hull and establishes a connection Valkyrie's access tunnel network. Unfortunately, the tunnels are a blind spot for you as you do not possess sensors within the network.

FUEL CONDUIT -> SELECT : TRUE

READY>get food bowl

The maintenance droid carefully turns the corner into the kitchen and looks around. Extending the antenna of his radio to get through the heavy shielding on the engineering deck, the maintenance droid radios, "Winter Shadow from maintenance droid: Just checking in. I'm in the engineering section. No contacts."

"Roger, maintenance droid. Telemetry is still five-by-five. Winter Shadow standing by."

ROVER grimaces as he watches the maintenance droid damage the ship.

HEAVY HELIUM SPHERE -> SELECT : TRUE

READY>open drawer
You open the reactor core, revealing a magnetic bottle.

The maintenance droid unscrews the handle of the frying pan, but you know that it is actually the main power coupling to the magnetic bottle. Fighting through the layer of simulation and blurry dream logic, you see him slap the red purge valve on the bottle's coolant system. Next, he reaches into the now inert bottle and snaps out the network bulb, separating the bottle from your consciousness.

ROVER keeps tabs on the maintenance droid from across the room.

Using the insulation struts as a ladder, the maintenance droid scales the rear of the cryo chamber looking for the coolant shutoff valve. Afterwards, he swings over the top of the unit and lands near the door. The maintenance droid tentatively touches the cryounit door, and reassured that the unit is no longer super cold inside. Too quietly to trip the voice-activated trasmission switch in his radio, he grumbles to himself, "I wonder if that light is on all the time or only when the door is open.". He swings open the heavy insulated door and after a brief survey of the interior of the cryounit, he removes the unit's main logic board, dropping the chamber off your network.

ROVERRover snaps his mining mandible open and shut, just behind the maintenance droid's head. The nervous maintenance droid casts a worried glance towards the sharp jaws, and picks up the pace of his work.

ACU -> MANIFEST : TRUE

Kitchen
Swaths of engineering controls -- both holographic and physical -- cover the humming consoles and bulkheads which line the boundaries of this alcove. Along one wall is the coolant output terminus, and below that the fuel storage vault, which is not properly secured. The opened reactor core and the fusion chamber are stacked just to the side of the cryochamber, which maintains the stabilized heavy helium fuel at near absolute zero until it is needed to provide power to ascent/descent retros. The cryochamber is open, chilling the engineering section.

You can see a maintenance droid, a coolant reservoir (empty), a fuel reservoir (empty), and ROVER here.

The maintenance droid clambers over a bulkhead towards the cooking range. Before going any closer, he radios,"This is maintenance droid to Winter Shadow, over."

"Winter Shadow. Go, maintenance droid."

"I'm standing right next to the fusion chamber. I just want to be sure... this thing is definitely off, right? I mean, it looks powered down now, but I don't want to go in there, and ... you know."

"Our scans show Valkyrie has no heavy helium. I repeat, the have no fusion fuel. You should be fine... if not, we're suiting up your backup. Over."

"Right. Okay, thanks. I'm going in." The maintenance droid runs into the fusion chamber, pulls the control unit out of the wall, the scene fades from your view. The maintenance droid re-emerges near the base of where the stove used to stand.

ROVER's fur stands on edge as he studies the maintenance droid.

Waving a geiger counter ahead like a crucifix against vampires, the maintenance droid approaches the reactor core. The geiger counter is whistling like a kettle on full boil.

"This is maintenance and repair robot designation zed-alpha-four. I am proceeding with deactivation of the reactor core. Radiation levels are high. I recommend full rad-decon when I return to the Winter Shadow. "

"Roger that. This is Winter Shadow standing by."

The maintenance droid pulls the telemetry bud on the reactor controller and from your perspective, the kitchen drawer winks out of existence.


ROVER grinds his tractors against the deck plating, momentarily distracting the maintenance droid.

ACU -> MANIFEST : TRUE

READY>give sphere to rover

You can't see that here; but you vaguely remember something called the "white egg".

The maintenance droid moves quickly out of the kitchen, glad to be finished with the reactor core.

The situation has become so dire that you try to deny the reality of events you are witnessing, but there is no respite. You consider your options for slowing down the cascading failures that are robbing you of your remaining functionality -- you still have some options to fight against the Myomita ship and its minions, but your chances for a rescue are dwindling.

It occurs to you, that the secondary mission objective may need to become primary: prevent Earth from recovering the Musashi 5 probe data. At all costs.

ROVER sniffs the maintenance droid suspiciously.

Instead of contaminating the ship with thermoisotope, you put the fuel conduit back in the vault before switching out of engineering. You place the He-8 back into the cryochamber before switching out of engineering.

Living Room
The Valkyrie's cargo bay is like a great, metal cave. Nothing remains of the Casimir Drive, which was neatly sliced off the ship by impossibly precise Myomita energy weapons. From this section of the ship, there are connections to the engineering and flight control decks. The cargo bay doors are closed.

You can see a maintenance droid here.

The maintenance droid takes the picture of you, Rover and Tomasz off the wall and connects it to some device which flickers and beeps. When he puts it back on the wall, the picture is dark.

"Moe's Gah! You wouldn't believe the data capacity of this thing -- and it's almost full!" gushes the maintenance droid.

"Acknowledged, maintenance droid, data stream is still being buffered over here. I think you've hit the mother load. You are authorized to return to Winter Shadow."

"Roger, Winter Shadow, I'm on the way!"

You've had so many nightmares about losing the data, it is hard to believe that this time it is happening, and that everything you have done is for naught.

OPERATIONS -> ACTIVATE : TRUE

READY>open door
(the cargo bay door)
You manage to open the cargo bay door only a couple centimeters when the maintenance droid exits through it -- it is not a pretty sight. As the pressure equalizes, the windstorm gently subsides, and the living room is silent.

You have lost control over all areas of the ship: flight control, operations, and engineering. The mission critical data which were your top priority have been leached from your membory banks. Now, power levels fluctuate just above zero, and remaining systems are failing faster than you can compensate. Cascading errors rip through your processors. Another series of explosive charges rock you, and all readouts go dead. As you spiral into unconsciousness, your feel a shameful sense of failure. You can't believe this is happening. It is too much to imagine. What kind of a sick nightmare...

The beeping of your proximity alert system wakens you from the nightmare as you emerge from Casimir Drive just planetward of Deimos. It takes a moment to extract yourself fully from the terrifying verisimilitude of the dream.

MARSpace picket ships register you almost immediately, and within minutes you are flanked by heavy gunships and tugs which escort you to the surface of Mars, back to where you started: the MARSpace facility at Cydonia.

After you settle into the drydock cradle and a hard seal is established on the cargo bay, two people walk into your living room through the front door. You recognize them immediately: David Venkatachalam and yourself, or rather, your alter ego in the flesh, Janet Xiang.

In a corner of the living room, Rover is fast asleep, the half-chewed bone still held scissor-fashion between his front paws.

ROVER cradles the space probe delicately in his sleep.

You can also see David, Janet, and a temporal transgressor here.

Rover slowly opens one eye, and then the other, and one paw abandons the bone momentarily to scratch his ear. He allows the bone to loll to one side of his mouth, and crunches it a bit more between his molars. He awakens leisurely, and sits up, glancing curiously at you, and then at Janet.

The Valkyrie's cargo bay is like a great, metal cave. On one wall, the Casimir Drive intrudes slightly into the cargo area. From this section of the ship, there are connections to the engineering and flight control decks. The cargo bay doors are open.

ROVER chews contently on his bone.

You can also see David, Janet, and a temporal transgressor here.

Janet fiddles with some controls on her arm band, and you become aware of noise coming from all areas of the ship: the hum of the plasma constrictor, the low vibration of the cryochamber, and other normal shipboard sounds, but also the footsteps and breathing of Janet and David, from the living room.

David walks under Rover's jaws and stares up disbelievingly at the mangled space probe, his hands on his hips and neck craned to assess the damage. He turns to Janet and remarks, "Gah-bedangled, look at that! Forty light years, and it comes back as so much scrap metal."

Janet turns to look at the probe, but is distracted by a beeping from her arm band, which displays some of your status indicators. She replies, "Dave, it looks like we have audio now. We can ask the ACU what happened."

 She looks at the ceiling and asks, "ACU, binary question: can you hear us?"

BINARY INPUT REQUIRED>1
Please answer yes or no.> yes
"Great," replies Janet, "Now we should be able to get some answers."

Janet continues, "I can see that your cognitive constraints are relaxed, so I think we can more or less put mimesis aside and talk frankly. You are still going to be constrained somewhat by the parser and your built-in vocabulary, but we should be able to squeak by enough to get an understanding of what you've been through. I'm sure you also have some questions about the mission that you'd like answered. You can use TELL and ASK verbs, for instance 'TELL ABOUT THE JADE FROG', or 'ASK ABOUT THE JADE FROG', although when you do it, you don't have to yell. I was just doing that for emphasis.

OPERATIONS -> ACTIVATE : TRUE

READY>tell janet about probe
You tell them that the probe had crashed forty years ago, on its way back to Earth. Like its sister probes that were launched from Earth almost three centuries ago by the Myomita corporation, it had explored space in an ever-expanding search pattern, refueling its condensate drive from the stellar wind of each star system it visited.

Apparently, it found a world which satisfied its search parameters because it was on its way back to Earth when it crashed. The stellar wind of a chaotic dying star required a close approach, and the probe was damaged by a stellar flare. Instead of tumbling into the star and burning, the probe ditched on a large, rocky planet, perhaps the core of a former gas giant. The planet itself was untenably close to the star, and was slowly being ripped to shreds by tidal forces, but the probe followed its programming and activated its transponder.

Listening intently, David now remarks, "Whatever that probe found, it was out way beyond any of the other Musashi probes. Likely, it's gone deeper into space than any probe Earth has ever sent."

Janet strokes her chin and asks, "I don't understand why you didn't contact us when you found the probe. Instead, you broke through your cognitive constraints and decided to fly it back to Earth."

David puts in hastily, "Costing us another 3 months, while we assumed the ship was lost!"

Janet resumes, "Regardless of the condition of the probe, you should automatically have contacted earth by ansible... Unless, I suppose there was a problem with the ansible. ACU, please tell us about the ansible."

You congratulate David on the accuracy of his prediction. The gravity was about nine and half times standard, or 93 meters per second squared.

"What?" cries David in surprise, "You wouldn't have had enough fusion fuel to get back into space!"

You explain that the ship's ansible, a faster than light communication system, was damaged during the landing: the planet was breaking apart due to tidal forces, and the atmosphere was unexpectedly turbulent and full of particulate matter. As you descended, most of the communications array snapped off, including the delicate ansible web. When the ansible failed, your programming threw a cognitive constraint exception, and you tried your best to carry out your programming by literally bringing the probe back to Mars.

"Ah, I knew there must have been a good explanation," remarks Janet.

"ACU, could you tell us about this Myomita ship that you mentioned?" asks Janet.

ACU -> SPEECH OUTPUT : TRUE

"But, how is that possible?" asks Janet incredulously. "I thought we were months, maybe years ahead of Earth in developing the Casimir Drive."

David replies, "That was a guess. They lost a lot of the Casimir team after the Independence War, but if anyone has resources to throw at a project, it would be Myomita."

READY>tell about finding probe
You find that that topic is not indexed.

David checks the system buffers.

ACU -> SPEECH OUTPUT : NIL

READY>ask about the mission
ACU -> QUERY : NIL

READY>ask about mission
David says dejectedly, "All that effort, and what do we have to show for it? Nothing. A rusty old heap of space junk. All the data, lost, and gone forever.""Intact? Then you have the data? This is too good to be true! Janet, would you extract the probe data from the ACU and transfer it to my MARSpace account?"

"Of course, just a moment. The data are encrypted... with your key. And there's something odd..."

"No," replies David, "that was intentional. To prevent it from falling into the wrong hands."

"No, not the encryption, David. The ansible coordinates -- the message was directed towards Earth. Isn't that odd?"

You hear the whine of a charged ray gun, and the mechnical click of its safety being released.

ACU -> QUERY : NIL

READY>i
You are carrying:
  an object linker
  a pit scrubber

"Dammit, Janet," cries David, "What a disappointment! Yes, the message was directed to Earth. The Valkyrie was our back-up plan in case our own ship ran into difficulty. I'm afraid that after the data transfer is complete, I'll have to kill you. A pity, I was really enjoying being with you. I had even picked out a china pattern.

David enunciates his words very precisely now,"ACU, this is a root command, authorization EarthRuleNow999: start data transfer!"

DATA TRANSFER: 0% COMPLETE

ACU -> MANIFEST : TRUE

READY>no
That was a rhetorical question.

Janet's voice quavers, "David, I can't believe this. After the last few months..."

David replies in an unnerving monotone, "After we didn't hear back from either ship, I'll admit that I was getting used to the idea of settling down with you. It would have been a good way to maintain cover within MARSpace, and eventually, we would have sent another mission to retrieve the probe."

DATA TRANSFER: 25% COMPLETE

ACU -> NEGATE : TRUE

READY>floss teeth
You have the object linker, but have not generated keys.

"Someone will hear the gun; you won't be able to walk out of here."

"My dear, the whole facility is secured by order of the mission director, that is to say, me. The probe data are such a sensitive subject that I had no difficulty getting authorization to lock down the entire facility. There's nobody here except us love birds."



DATA TRANSFER: 50% COMPLETE

HULL PLATING -> LINK NODES : NIL

READY>kill david
command not available from virtual console

READY>kill -9 david
command not available from virtual console

READY>go kitchen
The pit scrubber can only be activated from flight control, so you deaccess it. You disengage the object linker and reassign it to the flight console before transferring outs. 

Kitchen
Swaths of engineering controls -- both holographic and physical -- cover the humming consoles and bulkheads which line the boundaries of this alcove. Along one wall is the coolant output terminus, and below that the fuel storage vault. The reactor core and the fusion chamber are stacked just to the side of the cryochamber, which maintains the stabilized heavy helium fuel at near absolute zero until it is needed to provide power to ascent/descent retros.

You can see a coolant reservoir (empty) and a fuel reservoir (empty) here.

Janet takes a deep breath and says with resolve, "David, I'm sorry to do this, but ACU: I instruct you to stop David using any means necessary."

This elicits mocking laugh from David, who replies, "That's funny, Janet. Really. What's it going to do, 'examine' me to death? You know as well as I do that the ACU is entirely locked down by failsafe interdictions. Nice try."

DATA TRANSFER: 75% COMPLETE

ENGINEERING -> SELECT : TRUE

READY>open fridge
You can't see any such thing.

READY>crack egg in pan
You can't see any such thing.

READY>open cryochamber
You can't see any such thing.

READY>floss david
You can't see any such thing.

READY>i
You are carrying nothing.

Janet asks: "David, if you're going to shoot me, could you promise me to at least look after Rover?"

David snorts cynically, "Actually, you know what? I hate dogs."

DATA TRANSFER: 100% COMPLETE

ACU -> MANIFEST : TRUE
