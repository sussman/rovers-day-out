=============

Rover and Back on Mars
* Rover should stay put in the living room.
[ok, when Rover wakes, he looks back and forth in confusion] Rover should display some confusion between real Janet and ACU Janet

* Rover as a clue bat: We have an opportunity to convey hints via Rover if the player isn't making good time through various sections and/or appears to be stuck.

=====
other:
- make sure player will not walk into shower carrying stuff.
- hints about being naked/cold if the suit is off.
- would make sense to disable inventory description of the treat box
- if left alone with the treat box, Rover should do what comes naturally.
- instead of eating the dog treat....
- standing when already out of bed is interpreted as exiting (and standing in bathroom exits it, etc.)
- is flushing toilet still standing the player up?
- inhibit fussing around the door during real thing if we've already got the egg and the probe.
- ground as synonym for floor
- Rover needs his own remembers....like the Yorkie from across the park
- broaden read verb so that it doesn't "not see" items that are not inscriptions
- lick female dog should work

=======
after rover has brought back the egg and the probe, he no longer fusses at the door to go out, but he will go out if the door is open. TOCONSIDER: after getting the two items we need, he may lose all interest in going out even if the door is open.

- water dish, food dish smells
- go park
- room delegates
